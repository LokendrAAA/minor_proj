https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32277744/,"The development of digital pathology and progression of state-of-the-art algorithms for computer vision have led to increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL)-based AI, in tumor pathology. The DL-based algorithms have been developed to conduct all kinds of work involved in tumor pathology, including tumor diagnosis, subtyping, grading, staging, and prognostic prediction, as well as the identification of pathological features, biomarkers and genetic changes. The applications of AI in pathology not only contribute to improve diagnostic accuracy and objectivity but also reduce the workload of pathologists and subsequently enable them to spend additional time on high-level decision-making tasks. In addition, AI is useful for pathologists to meet the requirements of precision oncology. However, there are still some challenges relating to the implementation of AI, including the issues of algorithm validation and interpretability, computing systems, the unbelieving attitude of pathologists, clinicians and patients, as well as regulators and reimbursements. Herein, we present an overview on how AI-based approaches could be integrated into the workflow of pathologists and discuss the challenges and perspectives of the implementation of AI in tumor pathology.",1,,

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26572668/,"Spurred by advances in processing power, memory, storage, and an unprecedented wealth of data, computers are being asked to tackle increasingly complex learning tasks, often with astonishing success. Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games - tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome.",1,,

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35089332/,"Biomedical data are becoming increasingly multimodal and thereby capture the underlying complex relationships among biological processes. Deep learning (DL)-based data fusion strategies are a popular approach for modeling these nonlinear relationships. Therefore, we review the current state-of-the-art of such methods and propose a detailed taxonomy that facilitates more informed choices of fusion strategies for biomedical applications, as well as research on novel methods. By doing so, we find that deep fusion strategies often outperform unimodal and shallow approaches. Additionally, the proposed subcategories of fusion strategies show different advantages and drawbacks. The review of current methods has shown that, especially for intermediate fusion strategies, joint representation learning is the preferred approach as it effectively models the complex interactions of different levels of biological organization. Finally, we note that gradual fusion, based on prior biological knowledge or on search strategies, is a promising future research path. Similarly, utilizing transfer learning might overcome sample size limitations of multimodal data sets. As these data sets become increasingly available, multimodal DL approaches present the opportunity to train holistic models that can learn the complex regulatory dynamics behind health and disease.",1,,

      Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience, neural engineering (e.g. Brain-computer interfaces, BCI's), and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks?
    


          Approach:
        
      
      A systematic literature review of EEG classification using deep learning was performed on Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 90 identified studies. Those studies were analyzed based on type of task, EEG preprocessing methods, input type, and deep learning architecture.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      For EEG classification tasks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks outperform stacked auto-encoders and multi-layer perceptron neural networks in classification accuracy. The tasks that used deep learning fell into five general groups: emotion recognition, motor imagery, mental workload, seizure detection, event related potential detection, and sleep scoring. For each type of task, we describe the specific input formulation, major characteristics, and end classifier recommendations found through this review.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      This review summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes in the use of deep learning for EEG classification. Practical suggestions on the selection of many hyperparameters are provided in the hope that they will promote or guide the deployment of deep learning to EEG datasets in future research.",1,,
