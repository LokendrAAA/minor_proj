Abstract,label
"Understanding the extremely variable, complex shape and venation characters of angiosperm leaves is one of the most challenging problems in botany. Machine learning offers opportunities to analyze large numbers of specimens, to discover novel leaf features of angiosperm clades that may have phylogenetic significance, and to use those characters to classify unknowns. Previous computer vision approaches have primarily focused on leaf identification at the species level. It remains an open question whether learning and classification are possible among major evolutionary groups such as families and orders, which usually contain hundreds to thousands of species each and exhibit many times the foliar variation of individual species. Here, we tested whether a computer vision algorithm could use a database of 7,597 leaf images from 2,001 genera to learn features of botanical families and orders, then classify novel images. The images are of cleared leaves, specimens that are chemically bleached, then stained to reveal venation. Machine learning was used to learn a codebook of visual elements representing leaf shape and venation patterns. The resulting automated system learned to classify images into families and orders with a success rate many times greater than chance. Of direct botanical interest, the responses of diagnostic features can be visualized on leaf images as heat maps, which are likely to prompt recognition and evolutionary interpretation of a wealth of novel morphological characters. With assistance from computer vision, leaves are poised to make numerous new contributions to systematic and paleobotanical studies.",0
"Impairment of neuromuscular function in neurological disorders leads to reductions in muscle force, which may lower quality of life. Rehabilitation robots that are equipped with sensors are able to quantify the extent of muscle force impairment and to monitor a patient during the process of neurorehabilitation with sensitive and objective assessment methods. In this article, we provide an overview of fundamental aspects of muscle function and how the corresponding variables can be quantified by means of meaningful robotic assessments that are primarily oriented towards upper limb neurorehabilitation. We discuss new concepts for the assessment of muscle function, and present an overview of the currently available systems for upper limb measurements. These considerations culminate in practical recommendations and caveats for the rational quantification of force magnitude, force direction, moment of a force, impulse, critical force (neuromuscular fatigue threshold) and state and trait levels of fatigue.",0
"Cerebrovascular imaging is a common examination. Its accurate cerebrovascular segmentation become an important auxiliary method for the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases, which has received extensive attention from researchers. Deep learning is a heuristic method that encourages researchers to derive answers from the images by driving datasets. With the continuous development of datasets and deep learning theory, it has achieved important success for cerebrovascular segmentation. Detailed survey is an important reference for researchers. To comprehensively analyze the newest cerebrovascular segmentation, we have organized and discussed researches centered on deep learning. This survey comprehensively reviews deep learning for cerebrovascular segmentation since 2015, it mainly includes sliding window based models, U-Net based models, other CNNs based models, small-sample based models, semi-supervised or unsupervised models, fusion based models, Transformer based models, and graphics based models. We organize the structures, improvement, and important parameters of these models, as well as analyze development trends and quantitative assessment. Finally, we have discussed the challenges and opportunities of possible research directions, hoping that our survey can provide researchers with convenient reference.",0
"Deep neural networks often achieve high predictive accuracy on biological problems, but it can be hard to contextualize how and explain why predictions are made. In this issue, Kuenzi et al. model the sensitivity of cancers to drugs using deep neural networks with a hierarchical structure derived from the Gene Ontology.",0
"In this article, we develop a framework for showing that neural networks can overcome the curse of dimensionality in different high-dimensional approximation problems. Our approach is based on the notion of a catalog network, which is a generalization of a standard neural network in which the nonlinear activation functions can vary from layer to layer as long as they are chosen from a predefined catalog of functions. As such, catalog networks constitute a rich family of continuous functions. We show that under appropriate conditions on the catalog, catalog networks can efficiently be approximated with rectified linear unit-type networks and provide precise estimates on the number of parameters needed for a given approximation accuracy. As special cases of the general results, we obtain different classes of functions that can be approximated with recitifed linear unit networks without the curse of dimensionality.",0
"The biomedical scientific community is in the midst of a significant expansion in how data are used to accomplish the important goals of reducing disability and improving health care. Data science is the academic discipline emerging from this expansion. Data science reflects a new approach to the acquisition, storage, analysis, and interpretation of scientific knowledge. The potential benefits of data science are transforming biomedical research and will lead physical medicine and rehabilitation in exciting new directions. Understanding this transformation will require modifying and expanding the education, training, and research infrastructure that support rehabilitation science and practice.",0
"To improve the quality of the super-resolution (SR) reconstructed medical images, an improved adaptive multi-dictionary learning method is proposed, which uses the combined information of medical image itself and the natural images database. In training dictionary section, it uses the upper layer images of pyramid which are generated by the self-similarity of low resolution images. In reconstruction section, the top layer image of pyramid is taken as the initial reconstruction image, and medical image's SR reconstruction is achieved by regularization term which is the non-local structure self-similarity of the image. This method can make full use of the same scale and different scale similar information of medical images. Simulation experiments are carried out on natural images and medical images, and the experimental results show the proposed method is effective for improving the effect of medical image SR reconstruction.",0
"To quantitatively understand biological processes that occur over many hours or days, it is desirable to image multiple samples simultaneously, and automatically process and analyse the resulting datasets. Here, we present a complete multi-sample preparation, imaging, processing and analysis workflow to determine the development of the vascular volume in zebrafish. Up to five live embryos were mounted and imaged simultaneously over several days using selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM). The resulting large imagery dataset of several terabytes was processed in an automated manner on a high-performance computer cluster and segmented using a novel segmentation approach that uses images of red blood cells as training data. This analysis yielded a precise quantification of growth characteristics of the whole vascular network, head vasculature and tail vasculature over development. Our multi-sample platform demonstrates effective upgrades to conventional single-sample imaging platforms and paves the way for diverse quantitative long-term imaging studies.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI), a concept which dates back to the 1950s, is increasingly being developed by many medical specialties, especially those based on imaging or surgery. While the cognitive component of AI is far superior to that of human intelligence, it lacks consciousness, feelings, intuition and adaptation to unexpected situations. Furthermore, fundamental questions arise with regard to data security, the impact on healthcare professions, and the distribution of roles between physicians and AI especially concerning consent to medical care and liability in the event of a therapeutic accident.",0
"We evaluated a noncontingent reinforcement procedure that involved initially providing three subjects with signaled, continuous access to the functional reinforcer for aggression and slowly increasing the amount of time subjects were exposed to the signaled unavailability of the reinforcer. Additionally, alternative potential reinforcers were available throughout the sessions. Results showed immediate and substantial reductions in aggression for all three subjects. The clinical utility of this intervention is discussed, and future research directions are recommended.",0
"Due to its enormous potential, artificial intelligence (AI) can transform healthcare on a seemingly infinite scale. However, as we continue to explore the immense potential of AI, it is vital to consider the ethical concerns associated with its development and deployment. One specific concern that has been flagged in the literature is the responsibility gap (RG) due to the introduction of AI in healthcare. When the use of an AI algorithm or system results in a negative outcome for a patient(s), to whom can or should responsibility for that outcome be assigned? Although the concept of the RG was introduced in Anglo-American and European philosophy, this paper aims to broaden the debate by providing an Ubuntu-inspired perspective on the RG. Ubuntu, deeply rooted in African philosophy, calls for collective responsibility, and offers a uniquely forward-looking approach to address the alleged RG caused by AI in healthcare. An Ubuntu-inspired perspective can serve as a valuable guide and tool when addressing the alleged RG. Incorporating Ubuntu into the AI ethics discourse can contribute to a more ethical and responsible integration of AI in healthcare.",0
"Stereopsis is the three-dimensional perception capability, which is possible when binocular vision is present. Development of binocular vision system ends around 7-year-old, and after this time brain connections are already set, therefore, it will be difficult to recover stereopsis. Early diagnosis of Stereoscopic Visual Alterations (SVA) in the childhood is paramount to receive an appropriate treatment as soon as possible. Currently, to detect SVA, ophthalmologists commonly carry out tests based on cards. All these tests are based on the random-dot-stereogram principle, with different seconds of arc images, which allows doctors to graduate stereopsis. Some limits of this tests have been identified, such as monocular clues (e.g., the contours of the objects), or the non-standardized range levels depending on the test. This paper presents a novel concept of measuring stereopsis based on computer vision techniques. The system detects SVA in patients and calculates the degree of the perceived depth. As early diagnosis of SVA may suppose a therapeutic possibility, this platform is aimed at children by using stereoscopic models with varied and attractive designs. To validate the proposal, an early-stage prototype has been implemented and an objective evaluation of the measurement accuracy and reliability has been carried out with satisfactory results.",0
"We propose a scheme for the automatic separation (i.e., clustering) of data sets composed of several nanoparticle (NP) structures by means of Machine Learning techniques. These data sets originate from atomistic simulations, such as global optimizations searches and molecular dynamics simulations, which can produce large outputs that are often difficult to inspect by hand. By combining a description of NPs based on their local atomic environment with unsupervised learning algorithms, such as K-Means and Gaussian mixture model, we are able to distinguish between different structural motifs (e.g., icosahedra, decahedra, polyicosahedra, fcc fragments, twins, and so on). We show that this method is able to improve over the results obtained previously thanks to the successful implementation of a more detailed description of NPs, especially for systems showing a large variety of structures, including disordered ones.",0
"Hypothesis:
        
      
      Using image-guided surgical techniques, we propose that an industrial robot can be programmed to safely, effectively, and efficiently perform a mastoidectomy.
    



          Background:
        
      
      Whereas robotics is a mature field in many surgical applications, robots have yet to be clinically used in otologic surgery despite significant advantages including reliability and precision.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We designed a robotic system that incorporates custom software with an industrial robot to manipulate a surgical drill through a complex milling profile. The software controls the movements of the robot based on real-time feedback from a commercially available optical tracking system. The desired path of the drill to remove the desired volume of mastoid bone was planned using computed tomographic scans of cadaveric specimens and then implemented using the robotic system. Bone-implanted fiducial markers were used to provide accurate registration between computed tomographic and physical space.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A mastoid cavity was milled on 3 cadaveric specimens with a 5-mm fluted ball bit. Postmilling computed tomographic scans showed that, for the 3 specimens, 97.70%, 99.99%, and 96.05% of the target region was ablated without violation of any critical feature.
    
Early detection of cancer significantly improves survival rates, and medical imaging plays a crucial role in this process. This study utilizes artificial intelligence, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to enhance the accuracy of cancer detection in medical imaging, such as mammograms and CT scans. Trained on over 500,000 annotated images, the AI model achieved a 95% accuracy rate in detecting malignant tumors, outperforming traditional diagnostic methods. The study emphasizes the role of AI in augmenting radiologists' capabilities.

          Conclusion:
        
      
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a robot has been used to perform a mastoidectomy. Although significant hurdles remain to translate this technology to clinical use, we have shown that it is feasible. The prospect of reducing surgical time and enhancing patient safety by replacing human hand-eye coordination with machine precision motivates future work toward translating this technique to clinical use.",0
"Multiple animals ranging from micro-meter scale bacteria to meter scale vertebrates rely on undulatory motion to propel themselves on land and in the water. This type of locomotion also appears in amphibious animals such as sea snakes and salamanders. While undulatory motion can be used for both crawling and swimming, it requires the coordination of multiple joints so that only a few robots have the ability to mimic this motion. Here, we report a new minimalistic method for both crawling and swimming based on producing a wave motion in the sagittal (vertical) plane. A robotic prototype AmphiSAW was developed to demonstrate this methodology in a variety of scenarios. AmphiSAW (using its wave mechanism only) crawled at 1.5 B s-1and swam at 0.74 B s-1. The robot can be fitted with legs or wheels at the front, which can further increase its performance especially when crawling on uneven terrains. In addition to its high speeds, the robot has the lowest cost of transport among all amphibious robots reported in literature.",0
"Deep unfolding methods design deep neural networks as learned variations of optimization algorithms through the unrolling of their iterations. These networks have been shown to achieve faster convergence and higher accuracy than the original optimization methods. In this line of research, this paper presents novel interpretable deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs), designed by the unfolding of iterative algorithms that solve the task of sequential signal reconstruction (in particular, video reconstruction). The proposed networks are designed by accounting that video frames' patches have a sparse representation and the temporal difference between consecutive representations is also sparse. Specifically, we design an interpretable deep RNN (coined reweighted-RNN) by unrolling the iterations of a proximal method that solves a reweighted version of the l1 - l1 minimization problem. Due to the underlying minimization model, our reweighted-RNN has a different thresholding function (alias, different activation function) for each hidden unit in each layer. In this way, it has higher network expressivity than existing deep unfolding RNN models. We also present the derivative l1 - l1 -RNN model, which is obtained by unfolding a proximal method for the l1 - l1 minimization problem. We apply the proposed interpretable RNNs to the task of video frame reconstruction from low-dimensional measurements, that is, sequential video frame reconstruction. The experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed deep RNNs outperform various RNN models.",0
"Recent industrial robotics covers a broad part of the manufacturing spectrum and other human everyday life applications; the performance of these devices has become increasingly important. Positioning accuracy and repeatability, as well as operating speed, are essential in any industrial robotics application. Robot positioning errors are complex due to the extensive combination of their sources and cannot be compensated for using conventional methods. Some robot positioning errors can be compensated for only using machine learning (ML) procedures. Reinforced machine learning increases the robot's positioning accuracy and expands its implementation capabilities. The provided methodology presents an easy and focused approach for industrial in situ robot position adjustment in real-time during production setup or readjustment cases. The scientific value of this approach is a methodology using an ML procedure without huge external datasets for the procedure and extensive computing facilities. This paper presents a deep q-learning algorithm applied to improve the positioning accuracy of an articulated KUKA youBot robot during operation. A significant improvement of the positioning accuracy was achieved approximately after 260 iterations in the online mode and initial simulation of the ML procedure.",0
"Advanced machine intelligence is empowered not only by the ever-increasing computational capability for information processing but also by sensors for collecting multimodal information from complex environments. However, simply assembling different sensors can result in bulky systems and complex data processing. Herein, it is shown that a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imager can be transformed into a compact multimodal sensing platform through dual-focus imaging. By combining lens-based and lensless imaging, visual information, chemicals, temperature, and humidity can be detected with the same chip and output as a single image. As a proof of concept, the sensor is equipped on a micro-vehicle, and multimodal environmental sensing and mapping is demonstrated. A multimodal endoscope is also developed, and simultaneous imaging and chemical profiling along a porcine digestive tract is achieved. The multimodal CMOS imager is compact, versatile, and extensible and can be widely applied in microrobots, in vivo medical apparatuses, and other microdevices.",0
"Three experiments examined the effects of conditioned reinforcement value and primary reinforcement rate on resistance to change using a multiple schedule of observing-response procedures with pigeons. In the absence of observing responses in both components, unsignaled periods of variable-interval (VI) schedule food reinforcement alternated with extinction. Observing responses in both components intermittently produced 15 s of a stimulus associated with the VI schedule (i.e., S+). In the first experiment, a lower-valued conditioned reinforcer and a higher rate of primary reinforcement were arranged in one component by adding response-independent food deliveries uncorrelated with S+. In the second experiment, one component arranged a lower valued conditioned reinforcer but a higher rate of primary reinforcement by increasing the probability of VI schedule periods relative to extinction periods. In the third experiment, the two observing-response components provided similar rates of primary reinforcement but arranged different valued conditioned reinforcers. Across the three experiments, observing-response rates were typically higher in the component associated with the higher valued conditioned reinforcer. Resistance to change was not affected by conditioned reinforcement value, but was an orderly function of the rate of primary reinforcement obtained in the two components. One interpretation of these results is that S+ value does not affect response strength and that S+ deliveries increase response rates through a mechanism other than reinforcement. Alternatively, because resistance to change depends on the discriminative stimulus-reinforcer relation, the failure of S+ value to impact resistance to change could have resulted from a lack of transfer of S+ value to the broader discriminative context.",0

"The increasing implementation of and reliance on machine-learning (ML) algorithms to perform tasks, deliver services and make decisions in health and healthcare have made the need for fairness in ML, and more specifically in healthcare ML algorithms (HMLA), a very important and urgent task. However, while the debate on fairness in the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) and in HMLA has grown significantly over the last decade, the very concept of fairness as an ethical value has not yet been sufficiently explored. Our paper aims to fill this gap and address the AI ethics principle of fairness from a conceptual standpoint, drawing insights from accounts of fairness elaborated in moral philosophy and using them to conceptualise fairness as an ethical value and to redefine fairness in HMLA accordingly. To achieve our goal, following a first section aimed at clarifying the background, methodology and structure of the paper, in the second section, we provide an overview of the discussion of the AI ethics principle of fairness in HMLA and show that the concept of fairness underlying this debate is framed in purely distributive terms and overlaps with non-discrimination, which is defined in turn as the absence of biases. After showing that this framing is inadequate, in the third section, we pursue an ethical inquiry into the concept of fairness and argue that fairness ought to be conceived of as an ethical value. Following a clarification of the relationship between fairness and non-discrimination, we show that the two do not overlap and that fairness requires much more than just non-discrimination. Moreover, we highlight that fairness not only has a distributive but also a socio-relational dimension. Finally, we pinpoint the constitutive components of fairness. In doing so, we base our arguments on a renewed reflection on the concept of respect, which goes beyond the idea of equal respect to include respect for individual persons. In the fourth section, we analyse the implications of our conceptual redefinition of fairness as an ethical value in the discussion of fairness in HMLA. Here, we claim that fairness requires more than non-discrimination and the absence of biases as well as more than just distribution; it needs to ensure that HMLA respects persons both as persons and as particular individuals. Finally, in the fifth section, we sketch some broader implications and show how our inquiry can contribute to making HMLA and, more generally, AI promote the social good and a fairer society.",0
"Conventional approaches to developing biomaterials and implants require intuitive tailoring of manufacturing protocols and biocompatibility assessment. This leads to longer development cycles, and high costs. To meet existing and unmet clinical needs, it is critical to accelerate the production of implantable biomaterials, implants and biomedical devices. Building on the Materials Genome Initiative, we define the concept 'biomaterialomics' as the integration of multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools throughout the entire pipeline of biomaterials development. The Data Science-driven approach is envisioned to bring together on a single platform, the computational tools, databases, experimental methods, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing) to develop the fourth-generation biomaterials and implants, whose clinical performance will be predicted using 'digital twins'. While analysing the key elements of the concept of 'biomaterialomics', significant emphasis has been put forward to effectively utilize high-throughput biocompatibility data together with multiscale physics-based models, E-platform/online databases of clinical studies, data science approaches, including metadata management, AI/ Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and uncertainty predictions. Such integrated formulation will allow one to adopt cross-disciplinary approaches to establish processing-structure-property (PSP) linkages. A few published studies from the lead author's research group serve as representative examples to illustrate the formulation and relevance of the 'Biomaterialomics' approaches for three emerging research themes, i.e. patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine. The increased adaptability of AI/ML tools in biomaterials science along with the training of the next generation researchers in data science are strongly recommended. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This leading opinion review paper emphasizes the need to integrate the concepts and algorithms of the data science with biomaterials science. Also, this paper emphasizes the need to establish a mathematically rigorous cross-disciplinary framework that will allow a systematic quantitative exploration and curation of critical biomaterials knowledge needed to drive objectively the innovation efforts within a suitable uncertainty quantification framework, as embodied in 'biomaterialomics' concept, which integrates multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like machine learning. The formulation of this approach has been demonstrated for patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine.",0
"Natural language is ubiquitous in the workflow of medical imaging. Radiologists create and consume free text in their daily work, some of which can be amenable to enhancements through automatic processing. Recent advancements in deep learning and ""artificial intelligence"" have had a significant positive impact on natural language processing (NLP). This article discusses the history of how researchers have extracted data and encoded natural language information for analytical processing, starting from NLP's humble origins in hand-curated, linguistic rules. The evolution of medical NLP including vectorization, word embedding, classification, as well as its use in automated speech recognition, are also explored. Finally, the article will discuss the role of machine learning and neural networks in the context of significant, if incremental, improvements in NLP.",0
"Objects are defined by their content (""what"") and by their location (""where""). In the visual system, processing of these two types of information is segregated into distinct anatomical and functional pathways. Using H2 (15)O positron emission tomography to measure cerebral blood flow, we examined the differences in processing of ""what"" when compared with ""where"" information in human memory. We found that the detection of deviations from a previously learned image sequence activates distinct brain regions depending on whether the image's content or its location has changed. When deviations of an image's content had to be detected, the left medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation increased. In contrast, detection of deviations from the learned locations of the objects induced increased activation in the right MTL and in the right parietal cortex. These data demonstrate distinct contributions of the left and right MTL to the processing of ""what"" vs. ""where"" in memory.",0
"The field of natural language processing (NLP) has seen rapid advances in the past several years since the introduction of deep learning techniques.

This manuscript gives a brief introduction to deep learning and an overview of the current deep learning-based NLP technology.",0
"Introduction:
        
      
      Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women. In 2018, it was estimated 570000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide and about 311000 women died from the disease. An efficient technique is essential for solving the complication in the diagnosis of cervical cancer images.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      In this research, a new method is developed for cervical cancer image segmentation. First, the RGB image is converted into an HSI color model. The thresholding is applied to the saturation and intensity components to get binary images. These binary images are combined to get a new mask. Using the connected component concept nucleus and cytoplasm are segmented accurately.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For the performance evaluation, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), image quality index (IQI), structural content (SC), normalized cross-correlation (NK), precision (PR), recall (RC), the Average Difference (AD) and image fidelity (IF) are taken. The proposed techniques' highest PSNR values are 44.2341, 46.7953, 60.5925, and 61.4862, respectively. The proposed segmentation technique can attain a high PSNR (>40db) value at a threshold value equal to 0.1. Also proposed approach attains good precision, recall, and SSIM values.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The lowest MSE values using proposed segmentation techniques are 0.0454, 0.0351, 0.0924, and 0.0271 individually. The AD, NK, SC, NAE, and LMSE values for the implemented approach are low, showing the segmented image's quality is very good. Thus, the proposed model performed better compared to other methods.",0
"One of the main difficulties in assessing artificial intelligence (AI) is the tendency for people to anthropomorphise it. This becomes particularly problematic when we attach human moral activities to AI. For example, the European Commission's High-level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) have adopted the position that we should establish a relationship of trust with AI and should cultivate trustworthy AI (HLEG AI Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI, 2019, p. 35). Trust is one of the most important and defining activities in human relationships, so proposing that AI should be trusted, is a very serious claim. This paper will show that AI cannot be something that has the capacity to be trusted according to the most prevalent definitions of trust because it does not possess emotive states or can be held responsible for their actions-requirements of the affective and normative accounts of trust. While AI meets all of the requirements of the rational account of trust, it will be shown that this is not actually a type of trust at all, but is instead, a form of reliance. Ultimately, even complex machines such as AI should not be viewed as trustworthy as this undermines the value of interpersonal trust, anthropomorphises AI, and diverts responsibility from those developing and using them.",0

"There has been a call for evidence-based oral healthcare guidelines, to improve precision dentistry and oral healthcare delivery. The main challenges to this goal are the current lack of up-to-date evidence, the limited integrative analytical data sets, and the slow translations to routine care delivery. Overcoming these issues requires knowledge discovery pipelines based on big data and health analytics, intelligent integrative informatics approaches, and learning health systems. This article examines how this can be accomplished by utilizing big data. These data can be gathered from four major streams: patients, clinical data, biological data, and normative data sets. All these must then be uniformly combined for analysis and modelling and the meaningful findings can be implemented clinically. By executing data capture cycles and integrating the subsequent findings, practitioners are able to improve public oral health and care delivery.",0
"Astronomy is entering an era of mega-data that will render conventional research methods as well as data and visual analytics tools ineffective.

"By combining metal nodes with organic linkers we can potentially synthesize millions of possible metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The fact that we have so many materials opens many exciting avenues but also create new challenges. We simply have too many materials to be processed using conventional, brute force, methods. In this review, we show that having so many materials allows us to use big-data methods as a powerful technique to study these materials and to discover complex correlations. The first part of the review gives an introduction to the principles of big-data science. We show how to select appropriate training sets, survey approaches that are used to represent these materials in feature space, and review different learning architectures, as well as evaluation and interpretation strategies. In the second part, we review how the different approaches of machine learning have been applied to porous materials. In particular, we discuss applications in the field of gas storage and separation, the stability of these materials, their electronic properties, and their synthesis. Given the increasing interest of the scientific community in machine learning, we expect this list to rapidly expand in the coming years.",0

"Plant phenomics has been rapidly advancing over the past few years. This advancement is attributed to the increased innovation and availability of new technologies which can enable the high-throughput phenotyping of complex plant traits. The application of artificial intelligence in various domains of science has also grown exponentially in recent years. Notably, the computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning aspects of artificial intelligence have been successfully integrated into non-invasive imaging techniques. This integration is gradually improving the efficiency of data collection and analysis through the application of machine and deep learning for robust image analysis. In addition, artificial intelligence has fostered the development of software and tools applied in field phenotyping for data collection and management. These include open-source devices and tools which are enabling community driven research and data-sharing, thereby availing the large amounts of data required for the accurate study of phenotypes. This paper reviews more than one hundred current state-of-the-art papers concerning AI-applied plant phenotyping published between 2010 and 2020. It provides an overview of current phenotyping technologies and the ongoing integration of artificial intelligence into plant phenotyping. Lastly, the limitations of the current approaches/methods and future directions are discussed.",0
"Motivation:
        
      
      In a predictive modeling setting, if sufficient details of the system behavior are known, one can build and use a simulation for making predictions. When sufficient system details are not known, one typically turns to machine learning, which builds a black-box model of the system using a large dataset of input sample features and outputs. We consider a setting which is between these two extremes: some details of the system mechanics are known but not enough for creating simulations that can be used to make high quality predictions. In this context we propose using approximate simulations to build a kernel for use in kernelized machine learning methods, such as support vector machines. The results of multiple simulations (under various uncertainty scenarios) are used to compute similarity measures between every pair of samples: sample pairs are given a high similarity score if they behave similarly under a wide range of simulation parameters. These similarity values, rather than the original high dimensional feature data, are used to build the kernel.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We demonstrate and explore the simulation-based kernel (SimKern) concept using four synthetic complex systems-three biologically inspired models and one network flow optimization model. We show that, when the number of training samples is small compared to the number of features, the SimKern approach dominates over no-prior-knowledge methods. This approach should be applicable in all disciplines where predictive models are sought and informative yet approximate simulations are available.

"Objective:
        
      
      Computer vision syndromes are becoming a major public health concern. Inconsistent findings existed on computer vision syndrome. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of computer vision syndrome and identify its determinants.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this study, the review was developed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Online electronic databases, including PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, and Google Scholar, were used to retrieve studies from 1 December to 9 April 2022. Quality assessment of the studies was performed using the JBI-MAStARI. RevMan and STATA 14 software were used for statistical analysis.
    


          Result:
        
      
      A total of 725 studies were retrieved, and 49 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of computer vision syndrome was 66% (95%, Confidence interval: 59, 74). Being female (Odd Ratio = 1.74, 95% Confidence interval [1.2, 2.53]), improper body posturing while using electronic devices (Odd Ratio = 2.65, 95% Confidence interval [1.7, 4.12]), use of electronic devices out of work (Odd Ratio = 1.66, 95% CI [1.15, 2.39]), no habit of taking breaks (Odd Ratio = 2.24, 95% Confidence interval [1.13, 4.44]), long duration of visual display terminal use (Odd Ratio = 2.02, 95% Confidence interval [1.08, 3.77]), short distance screen (Odd Ratio = 4.24, 95% Confidence interval [2.33, 7.71]), and general ergonomic practice (Odd Ratio = 3.87, 95% Confidence interval [2.18, 6.86]) were associated with increased odds of computer vision syndrome. However, good knowledge (Odd Ratio = 4.04, 95% Confidence interval [2.75, 5.94]) of computer vision syndrome was associated with decreased odds of computer vision syndrome.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Nearly two in three participants had computer vision syndrome. Being female, improper body posturing, use of electronics devices out of work, no habit of taking a break, long-hour duration of visual display terminal use, short-distance screen, and general ergonomic practice were associated with increased odds of computer vision syndrome.",0
"Although Germany continues to struggle with the digital transformation of healthcare, there is reason for optimism. The political will to improve healthcare with digital technologies has been underpinned by numerous legal initiatives since 2018. In addition, there is growing acceptance among healthcare providers and the population. The latter has clearly been driven by the corona pandemic, which underscored the need for more digitized care.Digitalization in healthcare has three key drivers: the rapid technological development in data processing, the ever-improving understanding of the biological basis of human life, and growing patient sovereignty coupled with a growing desire for transparency. Prerequisites for digital medicine are data interoperability and the establishment of a networking (telematics) infrastructure (TI). The status of the most important digital TI applications affecting German healthcare are described: the electronic patient record (ePA) as its core as well as electronic prescriptions, medication plans, and communication tools such as Communication in Medicine (KIM) and TI Messenger (TIM). In addition, various telemedical offerings are discussed as well as the introduction of digital health applications (DiGA) into the statutory healthcare system, which Germany has pioneered. Furthermore, the use of medical data as the basis for artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms is discussed. While helpful and capable of improving diagnostics as well as medical therapy, such AI tools will not replace doctors and nurses.",0
"Deep-learning (DL) algorithms are becoming the standard for processing ultrasound (US) fetal images. A number of survey papers in the field is today available, but most of them are focusing on a broader area of medical-image analysis or not covering all fetal US DL applications. This paper surveys the most recent work in the field, with a total of 153 research papers published after 2017. Papers are analyzed and commented from both the methodology and the application perspective. We categorized the papers into (i) fetal standard-plane detection, (ii) anatomical structure analysis and (iii) biometry parameter estimation. For each category, main limitations and open issues are presented. Summary tables are included to facilitate the comparison among the different approaches. In addition, emerging applications are also outlined. Publicly-available datasets and performance metrics commonly used to assess algorithm performance are summarized, too. This paper ends with a critical summary of the current state of the art on DL algorithms for fetal US image analysis and a discussion on current challenges that have to be tackled by researchers working in the field to translate the research methodology into actual clinical practice.",0
"Objective:
        
      
      The use of standardized structured reports (SSR) and suitable terminologies like SNOMED-CT can enhance data retrieval and analysis, fostering large-scale studies and collaboration. However, the still large prevalence of narrative reports in our laboratories warrants alternative and automated labeling approaches. In this project, natural language processing (NLP) methods were used to associate SNOMED-CT codes to structured and unstructured reports from an Italian Digital Pathology Department.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two NLP-based automatic coding systems (support vector machine, SVM, and long-short term memory, LSTM) were trained and applied to a series of narrative reports.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The 1163 cases were tested with both algorithms, showing good performances in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with SVM showing slightly better performances as compared to LSTM (0.84, 0.87, 0.83, 0.82 vs 0.83, 0.85, 0.83, 0.82, respectively). The integration of an explainability allowed identification of terms and groups of words of importance, enabling fine-tuning, balancing semantic meaning and model performance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      AI tools allow the automatic SNOMED-CT labeling of the pathology archives, providing a retrospective fix to the large lack of organization of narrative reports.",0
"Research on artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare gained interest in recent years. However, the use of AI in daily clinical practice is still rare. We created and distributed an online survey among professionals working within the health informatics field to explore their views. The provided answers were classified into referring or not to: 1) Application areas; 2) Medical specialities; 3) Specific technologies; 4) Use cases; 5) Citizens involvement; and 6) Challenges. We received 42 valid responses. With regard to the sentiment of the answers, 71,4% were classified by the AFINN tool as being positive. In light of the open question, 76,2% of the respondents referred to possible applications areas. They think the most frequent uses will be for diagnostic, decision making and treatment. 54,8% of respondents referred to use cases, being personalized care and daily practice the most popular scenarios. 28,6% mentioned citizens' involvement, and 23,8% medical specialities in which AI might be used. There is a mostly positive attitude towards the application of AI in healthcare, in particular regarding its future use for realising routine tasks. From these results, we conclude that research should further focus on realising AI-based applications for relieving health professionals from repetitive tasks and optimize healthcare processes.",0
"Pandemic diseases such as plague have produced a vast amount of literature providing information about the spatiotemporal extent, transmission, or countermeasures. However, the manual extraction of such information from running text is a tedious process, and much of this information remains locked into a narrative format. Natural Language processing (NLP) is a promising tool for the automated extraction of epidemiological data, and can facilitate the establishment of datasets. In this paper, we explore the utility of NLP to assist in the creation of a plague outbreak dataset. We produced a gold standard list of toponyms by manual annotation of a German plague treatise published by Sticker in 1908. We investigated the performance of five pre-trained NLP libraries (Google, Stanford CoreNLP, spaCy, germaNER and Geoparser) for the automated extraction of location data compared to the gold standard. Of all tested algorithms, spaCy performed best (sensitivity 0.92, F1 score 0.83), followed closely by Stanford CoreNLP (sensitivity 0.81, F1 score 0.87). Google NLP had a slightly lower performance (F1 score 0.72, sensitivity 0.78). Geoparser and germaNER had a poor sensitivity (0.41 and 0.61). We then evaluated how well automated geocoding services such as Google geocoding, Geonames and Geoparser located these outbreaks correctly. All geocoding services performed poorly - particularly for historical regions - and returned the correct GIS information only in 60.4%, 52.7% and 33.8% of all cases. Finally, we compared our newly digitized plague dataset to a re-digitized version of the plague treatise by Biraben and provide an update of the spatio-temporal extent of the second pandemic plague outbreaks. We conclude that NLP tools have their limitations, but they are potentially useful to accelerate the collection of data and the generation of a global plague outbreak database.",0
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often criticised for being data inefficient and inflexible to changes in task structure. Part of the reason for these issues is that Deep RL typically learns end-to-end using backpropagation, which results in task-specific representations. One approach for circumventing these problems is to apply Deep RL to existing representations that have been learned in a more task-agnostic fashion. However, this only partially solves the problem as the Deep RL algorithm learns a function of all pre-existing representations and is therefore still susceptible to data inefficiency and a lack of flexibility. Biological agents appear to solve this problem by forming internal representations over many tasks and only selecting a subset of these features for decision-making based on the task at hand; a process commonly referred to as selective attention. We take inspiration from selective attention in biological agents and propose a novel algorithm called Selective Particle Attention (SPA), which selects subsets of existing representations for Deep RL. Crucially, these subsets are not learned through backpropagation, which is slow and prone to overfitting, but instead via a particle filter that rapidly and flexibly identifies key subsets of features using only reward feedback. We evaluate SPA on two tasks that involve raw pixel input and dynamic changes to the task structure, and show that it greatly increases the efficiency and flexibility of downstream Deep RL algorithms.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Despite continuous performance improvements, especially in clinical contexts, a major challenge of Artificial Intelligence based Decision Support Systems (AI-DSS) remains their degree of epistemic opacity. The conditions of and the solutions for the justified use of the occasionally unexplainable technology in healthcare are an active field of research. In March 2024, the European Union agreed upon the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), requiring medical AI-DSS to be ad-hoc explainable or to use post-hoc explainability methods. The ethical debate does not seem to settle on this requirement yet. This systematic review aims to outline and categorize the positions and arguments in the ethical debate.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a literature search on PubMed, BASE, and Scopus for English-speaking scientific peer-reviewed publications from 2016 to 2024. The inclusion criterion was to give explicit requirements of explainability for AI-DSS in healthcare and reason for it. Non-domain-specific documents, as well as surveys, reviews, and meta-analyses were excluded. The ethical requirements for explainability outlined in the documents were qualitatively analyzed with respect to arguments for the requirement of explainability and the required level of explainability.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The literature search resulted in 1662 documents; 44 documents were included in the review after eligibility screening of the remaining full texts. Our analysis showed that 17 records argue in favor of the requirement of explainable AI methods (xAI) or ad-hoc explainable models, providing 9 categories of arguments. The other 27 records argued against a general requirement, providing 11 categories of arguments. Also, we found that 14 works advocate the need for context-dependent levels of explainability, as opposed to 30 documents, arguing for context-independent, absolute standards.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The systematic review of reasons shows no clear agreement on the requirement of post-hoc explainability methods or ad-hoc explainable models for AI-DSS in healthcare. The arguments found in the debate were referenced and responded to from different perspectives, demonstrating an interactive discourse. Policymakers and researchers should watch the development of the debate closely. Conversely, ethicists should be well informed by empirical and technical research, given the frequency of advancements in the field.",0
"In recent years, with the rapid development of the Internet, online social networks have been continuously integrated with traditional interpersonal networks and research on information dissemination in social networks has gradually increased. This article studies and analyzes the multidimensional information network big data mining algorithm based on the finite element analysis method.

The experimental results show that the LIC algorithm is better than the CC algorithm, the DC algorithm, and the BC algorithm; its overall performance is improved by 30%, and the effect is better. The LIC algorithm can effectively and quickly determine the influential nodes, which is helpful for social network analysis.",0
"Purpose:
        
      
      With the development of digital X-ray imaging and processing methods, the categorization and analysis of massive digital radiographic images need to be automatically finished. What is crucial in this processing is the automatic retrieval and recognition of radiographic position. To address these concerns, we developed an automatic method to identify a patient's position and body region using only frequency curve classification and gray matching.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Our new method is combined with frequency analysis and gray image matching. The radiographic position was determined from frequency similarity and amplitude classification. The body region recognition was performed by image matching in the whole-body phantom image with prior knowledge of templates. The whole-body phantom image was stitched by radiological images of different parts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The proposed method can automatically retrieve and recognize the radiographic position and body region using frequency and intensity information. It replaces 2D image retrieval with 1D frequency curve classification, with higher speed and accuracy up to 93.78%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The proposed method is able to outperform the digital X-ray image's position recognition with a limited time cost and a simple algorithm. The frequency information of radiography can make image classification quicker and more accurate.",0
"Although health care expenditure per capita is higher in the USA than in any other country, more than 37 million Americans do not have health insurance, and 41 million more have inadequate access to care. Efforts are ongoing to repeal the Affordable Care Act which would exacerbate health-care inequities. By contrast, a universal system, such as that proposed in the Medicare for All Act, has the potential to transform the availability and efficiency of American health-care services. Taking into account both the costs of coverage expansion and the savings that would be achieved through the Medicare for All Act, we calculate that a single-payer, universal health-care system is likely to lead to a 13% savings in national health-care expenditure, equivalent to more than US$450 billion annually (based on the value of the US$ in 2017). The entire system could be funded with less financial outlay than is incurred by employers and households paying for health-care premiums combined with existing government allocations. This shift to single-payer health care would provide the greatest relief to lower-income households. Furthermore, we estimate that ensuring health-care access for all Americans would save more than 68 000 lives and 1·73 million life-years every year compared with the status quo.",0
"Recent developments in data science in general and machine learning in particular have transformed the way experts envision the future of surgery. Surgical Data Science (SDS) is a new research field that aims to improve the quality of interventional healthcare through the capture, organization, analysis and modeling of data. While an increasing number of data-driven approaches and clinical applications have been studied in the fields of radiological and clinical data science, translational success stories are still lacking in surgery. In this publication, we shed light on the underlying reasons and provide a roadmap for future advances in the field. Based on an international workshop involving leading researchers in the field of SDS, we review current practice, key achievements and initiatives as well as available standards and tools for a number of topics relevant to the field, namely (1) infrastructure for data acquisition, storage and access in the presence of regulatory constraints, (2) data annotation and sharing and (3) data analytics. We further complement this technical perspective with (4) a review of currently available SDS products and the translational progress from academia and (5) a roadmap for faster clinical translation and exploitation of the full potential of SDS, based on an international multi-round Delphi process.",0
"Aspiration lesions of the amygdala were found previously to produce a severe impairment in visual discrimination learning for auditory secondary reinforcement in rhesus monkeys (Gaffan and Harrison, 1987). To determine whether excitotoxic amygdala lesions would also produce this effect, we trained four naive rhesus monkeys on the same task. The monkeys were required to learn 40 new visual discrimination problems per session in a situation in which visual choices were guided by an auditory secondary reinforcer that had been previously associated with food reward. Bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala had no effect on the rate of learning visual discrimination problems for auditory secondary reinforcement. We also tested the amygdalectomized monkeys on a reinforcer devaluation task and compared their performance with a group of three normal monkeys. The monkeys first learned to discriminate 60 pairs of objects, baited with two different food rewards. Each of the food rewards was then devalued by selective satiation in two separate experimental sessions. Normal controls tended to avoid displacing objects that covered the devalued food to a significantly greater degree than did the amygdalectomized monkeys, indicating that the excitotoxic amygdala damage interfered with reinforcer devaluation effects. Our results are consistent with the idea that the amygdala is necessary for learning the association between stimuli and the value of particular food rewards; however, the amygdala is not necessary for maintaining the value of secondary reinforcers, once they have been learned.",0
"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Artificial intelligence is a broad set of sophisticated computer-based statistical tools that have become widely available. Cardiovascular medicine with its large data repositories, need for operational efficiency and growing focus on precision care is set to be transformed by artificial intelligence. Applications range from new pathophysiologic discoveries to decision support for individual patient care to optimization of system-wide logistical processes.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Machine learning is the dominant form of artificial intelligence wherein complex statistical algorithms 'learn' by deducing patterns in datasets. Supervised machine learning uses classified large data to train an algorithm to accurately predict the outcome, whereas in unsupervised machine learning, the algorithm uncovers mathematical relationships within unclassified data. Artificial multilayered neural networks or deep learning is one of the most successful tools. Artificial intelligence has demonstrated superior efficacy in disease phenomapping, early warning systems, risk prediction, automated processing and interpretation of imaging, and increasing operational efficiency.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Artificial intelligence demonstrates the ability to learn through assimilation of large datasets to unravel complex relationships, discover prior unfound pathophysiological states and develop predictive models. Artificial intelligence needs widespread exploration and adoption for large-scale implementation in cardiovascular practice.",0

      Rapid diagnosing is crucial for controlling malaria. Various studies have aimed at developing machine learning models to diagnose malaria using blood smear images; however, this approach has many limitations. This study developed a machine learning model for malaria diagnosis using patient information.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To construct datasets, we extracted patient information from the PubMed abstracts from 1956 to 2019. We used two datasets: a solely parasitic disease dataset and total dataset by adding information about other diseases. We compared six machine learning models: support vector machine, random forest (RF), multilayered perceptron, AdaBoost, gradient boosting (GB), and CatBoost. In addition, a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to address the data imbalance problem.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Concerning the solely parasitic disease dataset, RF was found to be the best model regardless of using SMOTE. Concerning the total dataset, GB was found to be the best. However, after applying SMOTE, RF performed the best. Considering the imbalanced data, nationality was found to be the most important feature in malaria prediction. In case of the balanced data with SMOTE, the most important feature was symptom.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results demonstrated that machine learning techniques can be successfully applied to predict malaria using patient information.",0
"Public procurement is viewed as a major market force that can be used to promote innovation and drive small and medium-sized enterprises growth. In such cases, procurement system design relies on intermediates that provide vertical linkages between suppliers and providers of innovative services and products. In this work we propose an innovative methodology for decision support in the process of supplier discovery, which precedes the final supplier selection. We focus on data gathered from community-based sources such as Reddit and Wikidata and avoid any use of historical open procurement datasets to identify small and medium sized suppliers of innovative products and services that own very little market shares. We look into a real-world procurement case study from the financial sector focusing on the Financial and Market Data offering and develop an interactive web-based support tool to address certain requirements of the Italian central bank. We demonstrate how a suitable selection of natural language processing models, such as a part-of-speech tagger and a word-embedding model, in combination with a novel named-entity-disambiguation algorithm, can efficiently analyze huge quantity of textual data, increasing the probability of a full coverage of the market.",0
"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in dermatology holds promise for enhancing clinical accuracy, enabling earlier detection of skin malignancies, suggesting potential management of skin lesions and eruptions, and promoting improved continuity of care. AI implementation in dermatology, however, raises several ethical concerns.

"Background:
        
      
      Emerging machine learning technologies are beginning to transform medicine and healthcare and could also improve the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. Currently, there are no systematic reviews that investigate, from a general perspective, how machine learning is used in a rare disease context. This scoping review aims to address this gap and explores the use of machine learning in rare diseases, investigating, for example, in which rare diseases machine learning is applied, which types of algorithms and input data are used or which medical applications (e.g., diagnosis, prognosis or treatment) are studied.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using a complex search string including generic search terms and 381 individual disease names, studies from the past 10 years (2010-2019) that applied machine learning in a rare disease context were identified on PubMed. To systematically map the research activity, eligible studies were categorized along different dimensions (e.g., rare disease group, type of algorithm, input data), and the number of studies within these categories was analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two hundred eleven studies from 32 countries investigating 74 different rare diseases were identified. Diseases with a higher prevalence appeared more often in the studies than diseases with a lower prevalence. Moreover, some rare disease groups were investigated more frequently than to be expected (e.g., rare neurologic diseases and rare systemic or rheumatologic diseases), others less frequently (e.g., rare inborn errors of metabolism and rare skin diseases). Ensemble methods (36.0%), support vector machines (32.2%) and artificial neural networks (31.8%) were the algorithms most commonly applied in the studies. Only a small proportion of studies evaluated their algorithms on an external data set (11.8%) or against a human expert (2.4%). As input data, images (32.2%), demographic data (27.0%) and ""omics"" data (26.5%) were used most frequently. Most studies used machine learning for diagnosis (40.8%) or prognosis (38.4%) whereas studies aiming to improve treatment were relatively scarce (4.7%). Patient numbers in the studies were small, typically ranging from 20 to 99 (35.5%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our review provides an overview of the use of machine learning in rare diseases. Mapping the current research activity, it can guide future work and help to facilitate the successful application of machine learning in rare diseases.",0

"In recent years, the score-based likelihood ratio (SLR) method for facial comparison has attracted considerable research attention. This method relies on the match scores that are calculated from the features obtained from facial recognition systems, deep learning based in particular. However, this concept has not been completely understood. Therefore, this study is aimed at investigating deep learning facial features, and the SLR levels of their match scores. We propose a new interpretation that the deep learning feature is a class characteristic. Based on a large-scale data set experiment, we present evidence that the log SLR value of deep learning features can reach 8 in some data sets. The study results imply that the SLR of deep learning features is a useful method for facial identification, especially when the suspected image is obtained via a CCTV camera.",0
"When children with ADHD are presented with behavioral choices, they struggle more than Typically Developing [TD] children to take into account contextual information necessary for making adaptive choices. The challenge presented by this type of behavioral decision making can be operationalized as a Conditional Discrimination Learning [CDL] task. We previously showed that CDL is impaired in children with ADHD. The present study explores whether this impairment can be remediated by increasing reward for correct responding or by reinforcing correct conditional choice behavior with situationally specific outcomes (Differential Outcomes). An arbitrary Delayed Matching-To-Sample [aDMTS] procedure was used, in which children had to learn to select the correct response given the sample stimulus presented (CDL). We compared children with ADHD (N = 45) and TD children (N = 49) on a baseline aDMTS task and sequentially adapted the aDMTS task so that correct choice behavior was rewarded with a more potent reinforcer (reward manipulation) or with sample-specific (and hence response-specific) reinforcers (Differential Outcomes manipulation). At baseline, children with ADHD performed significantly worse than TD children. Both manipulations (reward optimization and Differential Outcomes) improved performance in the ADHD group, resulting in a similar level of performance to the TD group. Increasing the reward value or the response-specificity of reinforcement enhances Conditional Discrimination Learning in children with ADHD. These behavioral techniques may be effective in promoting the learning of adaptive behavioral choices in children with ADHD.",0
"Screening is the only proven approach to reduce the mortality of breast cancer, but significant numbers of breast cancers remain undetected even when all quality assurance guidelines are implemented. With the increasing adoption of digital mammography systems, image processing may be a key factor in the imaging chain. Although to our knowledge statistically significant effects of manufacturer-recommended image processings have not been previously demonstrated, the subjective experience of our radiologists, that the apparent image quality can vary considerably between different algorithms, motivated this study. This article addresses the impact of five such algorithms on the detection of clusters of microcalcifications. A database of unprocessed (raw) images of 200 normal digital mammograms, acquired with the Siemens Novation DR, was collected retrospectively. Realistic simulated microcalcification clusters were inserted in half of the unprocessed images. All unprocessed images were subsequently processed with five manufacturer-recommended image processing algorithms (Agfa Musica 1, IMS Raffaello Mammo 1.2, Sectra Mamea AB Sigmoid, Siemens OPVIEW v2, and Siemens OPVIEW v1). Four breast imaging radiologists were asked to locate and score the clusters in each image on a five point rating scale. The free-response data were analyzed by the jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC) method and, for comparison, also with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method. JAFROC analysis revealed highly significant differences between the image processings (F = 8.51, p < 0.0001), suggesting that image processing strongly impacts the detectability of clusters. Siemens OPVIEW2 and Siemens OPVIEW1 yielded the highest and lowest performances, respectively. ROC analysis of the data also revealed significant differences between the processing but at lower significance (F = 3.47, p = 0.0305) than JAFROC. Both statistical analysis methods revealed that the same six pairs of modalities were significantly different, but the JAFROC confidence intervals were about 32% smaller than ROC confidence intervals. This study shows that image processing has a significant impact on the detection of microcalcifications in digital mammograms. Objective measurements, such as described here, should be used by the manufacturers to select the optimal image processing algorithm.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Sepsis, an acute and potentially fatal systemic response to infection, significantly impacts global health by affecting millions annually. Prompt identification of sepsis is vital, as treatment delays lead to increased fatalities through progressive organ dysfunction. While recent studies have delved into leveraging Machine Learning (ML) for predicting sepsis, focusing on aspects such as prognosis, diagnosis, and clinical application, there remains a notable deficiency in the discourse regarding feature engineering. Specifically, the role of feature selection and extraction in enhancing model accuracy has been underexplored.

"The ageing population has led to a surge in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in elderly healthcare worldwide. However, in the advancement of AI technologies, there is currently a lack of clarity about the types and roles of AI technologies in elderly healthcare. This scoping review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of AI technologies in elderly healthcare by exploring the types of AI technologies employed, and identifying their roles in elderly healthcare based on existing studies. A total of 10 databases were searched for this review, from January 1 2000 to July 31 2022. Based on the inclusion criteria, 105 studies were included. The AI devices utilized in elderly healthcare were summarised as robots, exoskeleton devices, intelligent homes, AI-enabled health smart applications and wearables, voice-activated devices, and virtual reality. Five roles of AI technologies were identified: rehabilitation therapists, emotional supporters, social facilitators, supervisors, and cognitive promoters. Results showed that the impact of AI technologies on elderly healthcare is promising and that AI technologies are capable of satisfying the unmet care needs of older adults and demonstrating great potential in its further development in this area. More well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed in the future to validate the roles of AI technologies in elderly healthcare.",0

"Machine learning has shown its importance in delivering healthcare solutions and revolutionizing the future of filtering huge amountd of textual content. The machine intelligence can adapt semantic relations among text to infer finer contextual information and language processing system can use this information for better decision support and quality of life care. Further, a learnt model can efficiently utilize written healthcare information in knowledgeable patterns. The word-document and document-document linkage can help in gaining better contextual information. We analyzed 124 research articles in text and healthcare domain related to the ML paradigm and showed the mechanism of intelligence to capture hidden insights from document representation where only a term or word is used to explain the phenomenon. Mostly in the research, document-word relations are identified while relations with other documents are ignored. This paper emphasizes text representations and its linage with ML, DL, and RL approaches, which is an important marker for intelligence segregation. Furthermore, we highlighted the advantages of ML and DL methods as powerful tools for automatic text classification tasks.",0
"Lensless imagers based on diffusers or encoding masks enable high-dimensional imaging from a single-shot measurement and have been applied in various applications. However, to further extract image information such as edge detection, conventional post-processing filtering operations are needed after the reconstruction of the original object images in the diffuser imaging systems. Here, we present the concept of a temporal compressive edge detection method based on a lensless diffuser camera, which can directly recover a time sequence of edge images of a moving object from a single-shot measurement, without further post-processing steps. Our approach provides higher image quality during edge detection, compared with the ""conventional post-processing method."" We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by both numerical simulation and experiments. The proof-of-concept approach can be further developed with other image post-processing operations or versatile computer vision assignments toward task-oriented intelligent lensless imaging systems.",0
"While the concept of big data has emerged over the past decade as a hot topic in nearly all areas of scientific inquiry, it has rarely been discussed in the context of autism research. In this commentary we describe aspects of big data that are relevant to autism research and methodological issues such as confounding and data error that can hamper scientific investigation. Although big data studies can have transformative impact, bigger is not always better, and big data require the same methodological considerations and interdisciplinary collaboration as ""small data"" to extract useful scientific insight.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) will continue to cause substantial changes within the field of radiology, and it will become increasingly important for clinicians to be familiar with several concepts behind AI algorithms in order to effectively guide their clinical implementation. This review aims to give medical professionals the basic information needed to understand AI development and research. The general concepts behind several AI algorithms, including their data requirements, training, and evaluation methods are explained. The potential legal implications of using AI algorithms in clinical practice are also discussed.",0
"Importance:
        
      
      Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has reached an all-time high, and health care leaders across the ecosystem are faced with questions about where, when, and how to deploy AI and how to understand its risks, problems, and possibilities.
    


          Observations:
        
      
      While AI as a concept has existed since the 1950s, all AI is not the same. Capabilities and risks of various kinds of AI differ markedly, and on examination 3 epochs of AI emerge. AI 1.0 includes symbolic AI, which attempts to encode human knowledge into computational rules, as well as probabilistic models. The era of AI 2.0 began with deep learning, in which models learn from examples labeled with ground truth. This era brought about many advances both in people's daily lives and in health care. Deep learning models are task-specific, meaning they do one thing at a time, and they primarily focus on classification and prediction. AI 3.0 is the era of foundation models and generative AI. Models in AI 3.0 have fundamentally new (and potentially transformative) capabilities, as well as new kinds of risks, such as hallucinations. These models can do many different kinds of tasks without being retrained on a new dataset. For example, a simple text instruction will change the model's behavior. Prompts such as ""Write this note for a specialist consultant"" and ""Write this note for the patient's mother"" will produce markedly different content.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Foundation models and generative AI represent a major revolution in AI's capabilities, ffering tremendous potential to improve care. Health care leaders are making decisions about AI today. While any heuristic omits details and loses nuance, the framework of AI 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 may be helpful to decision-makers because each epoch has fundamentally different capabilities and risks.",0
"Deep neural networks (DNNs), characterized by sophisticated architectures capable of learning a hierarchy of feature representations, have achieved remarkable successes in various applications. Learning DNN's parameters is a crucial but challenging task that is commonly resolved by using gradient-based backpropagation (BP) methods. However, BP-based methods suffer from severe initialization sensitivity and proneness to getting trapped into inferior local optima. To address these issues, we propose a DNN learning framework that hybridizes CC-based optimization with BP-based gradient descent, called BPCC, and implement it by devising a computationally efficient CC-based optimization technique dedicated to DNN parameter learning. In BPCC, BP will intermittently execute for multiple training epochs. Whenever the execution of BP in a training epoch cannot sufficiently decrease the training objective function value, CC will kick in to execute by using the parameter values derived by BP as the starting point. The best parameter values obtained by CC will act as the starting point of BP in its next training epoch. In CC-based optimization, the overall parameter learning task is decomposed into many subtasks of learning a small portion of parameters. These subtasks are individually addressed in a cooperative manner. In this article, we treat neurons as basic decomposition units. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, we devise a maturity-based subtask selection strategy to selectively solve some subtasks of higher priority. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over common-practice DNN parameter learning techniques.",0
"This paper investigates how the introduction of AI to decision making increases moral distance and recommends the ethics of care to augment the ethical examination of AI decision making. With AI decision making, face-to-face interactions are minimized, and decisions are part of a more opaque process that humans do not always understand. Within decision-making research, the concept of moral distance is used to explain why individuals behave unethically towards those who are not seen. Moral distance abstracts those who are impacted by the decision and leads to less ethical decisions. The goal of this paper is to identify and analyze the moral distance created by AI through both proximity distance (in space, time, and culture) and bureaucratic distance (derived from hierarchy, complex processes, and principlism). We then propose the ethics of care as a moral framework to analyze the moral implications of AI. The ethics of care brings to the forefront circumstances and context, interdependence, and vulnerability in analyzing algorithmic decision making.",0
"Robots in orthopedic surgery have been developed rapidly for decades and bring significant benefits to the patients and healthcare providers. However, robotics in fracture reduction remains at the infant stage. As essential components of the current robotic system, external fixators were used in fracture reduction, including the unilateral and Ilizarov-like ring fixators. With emerging of the industrial robots and mechanical arms, their sterilized variants were developed as the serial robots, including the traction device and robotic arm, for fracture reduction. Besides, parallel robots (e.g., Gough-Stewart platform) were devised for lower extremity traction and fracture reduction. After combining the advantages of the serial and parallel mechanisms, hybrid robots can fulfill specific clinical requirements (e.g., the joint fracture, including multiple major fragments). Furthermore, with the aid of intra-operative navigation systems, fracture reduction can be performed under real-time guidance. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the advancement of the robots in fracture reduction and evaluates research challenges and future perspectives, including ergonomic and economic issues, operation time, artificial realities and intelligence, and telesurgery.",0
"In this paper, we study fixed-deviation stabilization and synchronization for fractional-order complex-valued neural networks with delays. By applying fractional calculus and fixed-deviation stability theory, sufficient conditions are given to ensure the fixed-deviation stabilization and synchronization for fractional-order complex-valued neural networks under the linear discontinuous controller. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to show the validity of theoretical results.",0
"Computer vision systems (CVS) are applied to macro- and microscopic digital photographs captured using digital cameras, ultrasound scanners, computer tomography, and wide-angle imaging cameras. Diverse image acquisition devices make it technically feasible to obtain information about both the external features and internal structures of targeted objects. Attributes measured in CVS can be used to evaluate meat quality. CVS are also used in research related to assessing the composition of animal carcasses, which might help determine the impact of cross-breeding or rearing systems on the quality of meat. The results obtained by the CVS technique also contribute to assessing the impact of technological treatments on the quality of raw and cooked meat. CVS have many positive attributes including objectivity, non-invasiveness, speed, and low cost of analysis and systems are under constant development an improvement. The present review covers computer vision system techniques, stages of measurements, and possibilities for using these to assess carcass and meat quality.",0
"Numerous cellular functions rely on protein-protein interactions. Efforts to comprehensively characterize them remain challenged however by the diversity of molecular recognition mechanisms employed within the proteome. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for tackling this problem by exploiting both experimental data and basic biophysical knowledge about protein interactions. Here, we review the growing ecosystem of deep learning methods for modeling protein interactions, highlighting the diversity of these biophysically informed models and their respective trade-offs. We discuss recent successes in using representation learning to capture complex features pertinent to predicting protein interactions and interaction sites, geometric deep learning to reason over protein structures and predict complex structures, and generative modeling to design de novo protein assemblies. We also outline some of the outstanding challenges and promising new directions. Opportunities abound to discover novel interactions, elucidate their physical mechanisms, and engineer binders to modulate their functions using deep learning and, ultimately, unravel how protein interactions orchestrate complex cellular behaviors.",0
"Natural language processing includes a variety of techniques that help to extract meaning from narrative data. In healthcare, medical natural language processing has been a growing field of study; however, little is known about its use in nursing. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL and found 689 studies, narrowed to 43 eligible studies using natural language processing in nursing notes. Data related to the study purpose, patient population, methodology, performance evaluation metrics, and quality indicators were extracted for each study. The majority (86%) of the studies were conducted from 2015 to 2021. Most of the studies (58%) used inpatient data. One of four studies used data from open-source databases. The most common standard terminologies used were the Unified Medical Language System and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, whereas nursing-specific standard terminologies were used only in eight studies. Full system performance metrics (eg, F score) were reported for 61% of applicable studies. The overall number of nursing natural language processing publications remains relatively small compared with the other medical literature. Future studies should evaluate and report appropriate performance metrics and use existing standard nursing terminologies to enable future scalability of the methods and findings.",0
"In recent years, the volume of digitalized web-based information utilizing modern computer-based technology for data storage, processing, and analysis has grown rapidly. Humans can process a limited number of variables at any given time. Thus, the deluge of clinically useful information in the intensive care unit environment remains untapped. Innovations in machine learning technology with the development of deep neural networks and efficient, cost-effective data archival systems have provided the infrastructure to apply artificial intelligence on big data for determination of clinical events and outcomes. Here, we introduce a few computer-based technologies that have been tested across these domains.",0
"Robotically assisted operations are the state of the art in laparoscopic general surgery. They are established predominantly for elective operations. Since laparoscopy is widely used in urgent general surgery, the significance of robotic assistance in urgent operations is of interest. Currently, there are few data on robotic-assisted operations in urgent surgery. The aim of this study was to collect and classify the existing studies. A two-stage, PRISMA-compliant literature search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library was conducted. We analyzed all articles on robotic surgery associated with urgent general surgery resp. acute surgical diseases of the abdomen. Gynecological and urological diseases so as vascular surgery, except mesenterial ischemia, were excluded. Studies and case reports/series published between 1980 and 2021 were eligible for inclusion. In addition to a descriptive synopsis, various outcome parameters were systematically recorded. Fifty-two studies of operations for acute appendicitis and cholecystitis, hernias and acute conditions of the gastrointestinal tract were included. The level of evidence is low. Surgical robots in the narrow sense and robotic camera mounts were used. All narrow-sense robots are nonautonomous systems; in 82%, the Da Vinci® system was used. The most frequently published emergency operations were urgent cholecystectomies (30 studies, 703 patients) followed by incarcerated hernias (9 studies, 199 patients). Feasibility of robotic operations was demonstrated for all indications. Neither robotic-specific problems nor extensive complication rates were reported. Various urgent operations in general surgery can be performed robotically without increased risk. The available data do not allow a final evidence-based assessment.",0
"We study the generalization capacity of group convolutional neural networks. We identify precise estimates for the VC dimensions of simple sets of group convolutional neural networks. In particular, we find that for infinite groups and appropriately chosen convolutional kernels, already two-parameter families of convolutional neural networks have an infinite VC dimension, despite being invariant to the action of an infinite group.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform clinical practice and healthcare.

This review describes the state-of-the-art use of AI in microbiome-related healthcare. It points out limitations across topics such as data handling, AI modelling and safeguarding patient privacy. Furthermore, we indicate how these current shortcomings could be overcome in the future and discuss the influence and opportunities of increasingly complex data on microbiome-based healthcare.",0
"Background:
        
      
      One of the most significant limitations of surgical robots has been their inability to allow multiple surgeons and surgeons-in-training to engage in collaborative control of robotic surgical instruments. We report the initial experience with a novel two-headed da Vinci surgical robot that has two collaborative modes: the ""swap"" mode allows two surgeons to simultaneously operate and actively swap control of the robot's four arms, and the ""nudge"" mode allows them to share control of two of the robot's arms.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The utility of the mentoring console operating in its two collaborative modes was evaluated through a combination of dry laboratory exercises and animal laboratory surgery. The results from surgeon-resident collaborative performance of complex three-handed surgical tasks were compared to results from single-surgeon and single-resident performance. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Collaborative surgeon-resident swap control reduced the time to completion of complex three-handed surgical tasks by 25% compared to single-surgeon operation of a four-armed da Vinci (P < 0.01) and by 34% compared to single-resident operation (P < 0.001). While swap mode was found to be most helpful during parts of surgical procedures that require multiple hands (such as isolation and division of vessels), nudge mode was particularly useful for guiding a resident's hands during crucially precise steps of an operation (such as proper placement of stitches).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The da Vinci mentoring console greatly facilitates surgeon collaboration during robotic surgery and improves the performance of complex surgical tasks. The mentoring console has the potential to improve resident participation in surgical robotics cases, enhance resident education in surgical training programs engaged in surgical robotics, and improve patient safety during robotic surgery.",0
"There is a vast development of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years. Computational technology, digitized data collection and enormous advancement in this field have allowed AI applications to penetrate the core human area of specialization. In this review article, we describe current progress achieved in the AI field highlighting constraints on smooth development in the field of medical AI sector, with discussion of its implementation in healthcare from a commercial, regulatory and sociological standpoint. Utilizing sizable multidimensional biological datasets that contain individual heterogeneity in genomes, functionality and milieu, precision medicine strives to create and optimize approaches for diagnosis, treatment methods and assessment. With the arise of complexity and expansion of data in the health-care industry, AI can be applied more frequently. The main application categories include indications for diagnosis and therapy, patient involvement and commitment and administrative tasks. There has recently been a sharp rise in interest in medical AI applications due to developments in AI software and technology, particularly in deep learning algorithms and in artificial neural network (ANN). In this overview, we enlisted the major categories of issues that AI systems are ideally equipped to resolve followed by clinical diagnostic tasks. It also includes a discussion of the future potential of AI, particularly for risk prediction in complex diseases, and the difficulties, constraints and biases that must be meticulously addressed for the effective delivery of AI in the health-care sector.",0
"Purpose:
        
      
      Insufficient image contrast associated with radiation therapy daily setup x-ray images could negatively affect accurate patient treatment setup. We developed a method to perform automatic and user-independent contrast enhancement on 2D kilo voltage (kV) and megavoltage (MV) x-ray images. The goal was to provide tissue contrast optimized for each treatment site in order to support accurate patient daily treatment setup and the subsequent offline review.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The proposed method processes the 2D x-ray images with an optimized image processing filter chain, which consists of a noise reduction filter and a high-pass filter followed by a contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) filter. The most important innovation is to optimize the image processing parameters automatically to determine the required image contrast settings per disease site and imaging modality. Three major parameters controlling the image processing chain, i.e., the Gaussian smoothing weighting factor for the high-pass filter, the block size, and the clip limiting parameter for the CLAHE filter, were determined automatically using an interior-point constrained optimization algorithm.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-two kV and MV x-ray images were included in this study. The results were manually evaluated and ranked with scores from 1 (worst, unacceptable) to 5 (significantly better than adequate and visually praise worthy) by physicians and physicists. The average scores for the images processed by the proposed method, the CLAHE, and the best window-level adjustment were 3.92, 2.83, and 2.27, respectively. The percentage of the processed images received a score of 5 were 48, 29, and 18%, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The proposed method is able to outperform the standard image contrast adjustment procedures that are currently used in the commercial clinical systems. When the proposed method is implemented in the clinical systems as an automatic image processing filter, it could be useful for allowing quicker and potentially more accurate treatment setup and facilitating the subsequent offline review and verification.",0
"Advanced computer vision mechanisms have been inspired by neuroscientific findings. However, with the focus on improving benchmark achievements, technical solutions have been shaped by application and engineering constraints. This includes the training of neural networks which led to the development of feature detectors optimally suited to the application domain. However, the limitations of such approaches motivate the need to identify computational principles, or motifs, in biological vision that can enable further foundational advances in machine vision. We propose to utilize structural and functional principles of neural systems that have been largely overlooked. They potentially provide new inspirations for computer vision mechanisms and models. Recurrent feedforward, lateral, and feedback interactions characterize general principles underlying processing in mammals. We derive a formal specification of core computational motifs that utilize these principles. These are combined to define model mechanisms for visual shape and motion processing. We demonstrate how such a framework can be adopted to run on neuromorphic brain-inspired hardware platforms and can be extended to automatically adapt to environment statistics. We argue that the identified principles and their formalization inspires sophisticated computational mechanisms with improved explanatory scope. These and other elaborated, biologically inspired models can be employed to design computer vision solutions for different tasks and they can be used to advance neural network architectures of learning.",0
"As graph neural networks are becoming more and more powerful and useful in the field of drug discovery, many pharmaceutical companies are getting interested in utilizing these methods for their own in-house frameworks. This is especially compelling for tasks such as the prediction of molecular properties which is often one of the most crucial tasks in computer-aided drug discovery workflows. The immense hype surrounding these kinds of algorithms has led to the development of many different types of promising architectures and in this review we try to structure this highly dynamic field of AI-research by collecting and classifying 80 GNNs that have been used to predict more than 20 molecular properties using 48 different datasets.",0
"Mathematical modeling of the fermentation process is useful for understanding the influence of operating parameters on target production and control performance, depending on the situation, to stabilize the target production at a high-level. However, the previous approaches using physical modeling methods and traditional knowledge-based methods are difficult to apply on working fermentors at a commercial plant scale because they have unknown and unmeasured parameters involved in target production. This study focused on developing an ensemble learning model that can predict the amino acid fermentation process behavior based on observation values, which can be obtained from fermentation tanks and future control input. The results revealed the influence of each control input on lysine production during the culturing period. Furthermore, high-order stability, which achieved the target trajectory for lysine production, was realized using dynamic fermentation controls. Additionally, this study demonstrates that the fermentation behavior on a commercial plant scale is reproduced using the ensemble device. The ensemble learning model will provide novel control system with data-science based model of Industry 4.0 in the field of biotechnological processes.",0
"As computers become part of our everyday life, more and more people are experiencing a variety of ocular symptoms related to computer use. These include eyestrain, tired eyes, irritation, redness, blurred vision, and double vision, collectively referred to as computer vision syndrome. This article describes both the characteristics and treatment modalities that are available at this time. Computer vision syndrome symptoms may be the cause of ocular (ocular-surface abnormalities or accommodative spasms) and/or extraocular (ergonomic) etiologies. However, the major contributor to computer vision syndrome symptoms by far appears to be dry eye. The visual effects of various display characteristics such as lighting, glare, display quality, refresh rates, and radiation are also discussed. Treatment requires a multidirectional approach combining ocular therapy with adjustment of the workstation. Proper lighting, anti-glare filters, ergonomic positioning of computer monitor and regular work breaks may help improve visual comfort. Lubricating eye drops and special computer glasses help relieve ocular surface-related symptoms. More work needs to be done to specifically define the processes that cause computer vision syndrome and to develop and improve effective treatments that successfully address these causes.",0
"Chemometrics play a critical role in biosensors-based detection, analysis, and diagnosis. Nowadays, as a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) have achieved impressive advances. However, novel advanced ML methods, especially deep learning, which is famous for image analysis, facial recognition, and speech recognition, has remained relatively elusive to the biosensor community. Herein, how ML can be beneficial to biosensors is systematically discussed. The advantages and drawbacks of most popular ML algorithms are summarized on the basis of sensing data analysis. Specially, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are emphasized. Diverse ML-assisted electrochemical biosensors, wearable electronics, SERS and other spectra-based biosensors, fluorescence biosensors and colorimetric biosensors are comprehensively discussed. Furthermore, biosensor networks and multibiosensor data fusion are introduced. This review will nicely bridge ML with biosensors, and greatly expand chemometrics for detection, analysis, and diagnosis.",0
"There is great interest in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications for medical imaging in general and specifically in breast imaging. Because of the scale of application and the potential for harm, there has been a parallel interest in assuring that these new technologies are scrutinized and applied in ethical ways. The four principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice are widely accepted as a framework for bioethical analysis. We incorporate a fifth principle of explicability (adapted from Floridi and Cowls) because of the unique considerations of AI. We review definitions of each of these principles and provide examples of their practical application to breast imaging.",0
"Delay of reinforcement is generally thought to be inversely correlated with speed of acquisition. However, in the case of simultaneous discrimination learning, in which choice results in immediate reinforcement, delay of reinforcement can improve acquisition. For example, in the ephemeral reward task, animals are given a choice between two alternatives, A and B. Choice of A provides reinforcement, and the trial is over. Choice of B provides reinforcement and access to alternative A (thus, two reinforcements). Many animals appear unable to learn to choose B consistently, but inserting a 20-s delay between choice and outcome has been shown to facilitate optimal choice. Similarly, pigeons given a choice between a signal for one pellet and a signal for two pellets (each occurring without a delay) have difficulty learning to choose the two-pellet alternative, unless the reinforcement is delayed. In a version of object permanence, food is placed in one of two containers, and the pigeon must choose the container with the food. Pigeons have difficulty reliably choosing the correct container unless a brief delay is inserted between baiting and choice. Finally, pigeons have been shown to prefer a suboptimal alternative (a 20% chance of getting a cue for reinforcement) over an optimal alternative (a 100% chance of getting a cue for 50% reinforcement). However, if pigeons are forced to wait 20 s following their choice to receive the cues, no preference for the suboptimal alternative is found. Thus, impulsive choice may be reduced by delaying the consequence of that choice.",0
"This study aimed to investigate and summarise the current state of research and trends in orthopaedic surgical robots. Data on publicly available publications related to orthopaedic surgical robots were extracted by abstract searches of the Web of Science Core Collection database. A bibliometric analysis and detailed reading of the publications were then carried out and the information was visualised using co-authorship analysis, coupling analysis, co-citation analysis and co-occurrence analysis in VOSviewer. With 436 publications included in the study from 1993 to 2022, the overall contribution of publications to the world showed an increasing trend year by year, with a particularly pronounced after 2017, and a geographical trend of predominantly East Asia, North America, and Western Europe. Of these, China was the largest contributor (n = 128). Overall, the UK affiliates and their scholars were leaders in the field, with a high number of publications, total citations, average citations per article and H-index. The most published institutions and authors were Imperial College London (n = 21) and Professor Fares Sahi Haddad of University College London (n = 12), respectively. Journals with a high overall impact on robotic orthopaedic surgery were the Journal of Arthroplasty, Bone Joint Journal, International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery. Keyword co-occurrence network analysis revealed four main clusters: robot-assisted knee, hip arthroplasty, spine surgery, and robotic technology research and development. The top three most common sites for robot-assisted surgery use were the knee, hip and spine. The most used robot types were the knee and spine, with Mako and Arobot being the most used robots for the knee and TiRobot for the spine. This study comprehensively reveals the current status and trends of global research on orthopaedic surgical robots, covering countries, institutions, authors, journals, research hotspots, robot types and surgical sites, providing directional guidance and research ideas for further research on the technological development and clinical evaluation of orthopaedic surgical robots.",0
"Artificial intelligence is spreading rapidly in business products and processes, with innovations that bring great benefits to society; however, significant risks also arise. AI-enabled systems make decisions autonomously and influence users and the environment, presenting multiple ethical issues. This work focuses on the ethics of AI use in business. We conduct a survey of business journal articles published between 2000 and mid-2021 to identify the most influential journals, articles, and authors, the most influential ethical schools, and the main ethical issues of AI in business. It describes the state-of-the-art in the field and identifies trends in ethical issues arising from AI. Thus, we present maps and trends of the ethics in AI in business literature.",0
"The rapidly growing scale and variety of biomedical data repositories raise important privacy concerns. Conventional frameworks for collecting and sharing human subject data offer limited privacy protection, often necessitating the creation of data silos. Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) promise to safeguard these data and broaden their usage by providing means to share and analyze sensitive data while protecting privacy. Here, we review prominent PETs and illustrate their role in advancing biomedicine. We describe key use cases of PETs and their latest technical advances and highlight recent applications of PETs in a range of biomedical domains. We conclude by discussing outstanding challenges and social considerations that need to be addressed to facilitate a broader adoption of PETs in biomedical data science.",0
"With the continuous progress of development, deep learning has made good progress in the analysis and recognition of images, which has also triggered some researchers to explore the area of combining deep learning with hyperspectral medical images and achieve some progress. This paper introduces the principles and techniques of hyperspectral imaging systems, summarizes the common medical hyperspectral imaging systems, and summarizes the progress of some emerging spectral imaging systems through analyzing the literature.

"NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is advancing research capabilities for data science with two of the National Cancer Institute's major research programs, the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) and the Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions (MCL), by enabling data-driven discovery for cancer biomarker research. The research team pioneered a national data science ecosystem for cancer biomarker research to capture, process, manage, share, and analyze data across multiple research centers. By collaborating on software and data-driven methods developed for space and earth science research, the biomarker research community is heavily leveraging similar capabilities to support the data and computational demands to analyze research data. This includes linking diverse data from clinical phenotypes to imaging to genomics. The data science infrastructure captures and links data from over 1600 annotations of cancer biomarkers to terabytes of analysis results on the cloud in a biomarker data commons known as ""LabCAS"". As the data increases in size, it is critical that automated approaches be developed to ""plug"" laboratories and instruments into a data science infrastructure to systematically capture and analyze data directly. This includes the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate annotation and scale science analysis.",0
"Radiotherapy is one of the main treatments for tumor with increasingly high request for technique precision and the equipment stability. Machine learning may bring radiotherapy simplicity, individualization and precision, and may improve the automatic level of planning and quality assurance. Based on the process of radiotherapy, this paper reviews the applications and researches on machine learning, with an emphasis on deep learning, and proposes the prospects in the following aspects: segmentation of normal tissue and tumor, planning, treatment delivery, quality assurance and prognosis prediction.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Gibbs artifacts, appearing as oscillations or ringing around sharp edges or boundaries, are frequently encountered in image processing. They arise when the image's frequency components are adjusted, such as in image deblurring and sharpening. Linear methods are ineffective in reducing Gibbs artifacts; nonlinear methods may be more effective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One such nonlinear method is the use of neural networks. This paper applies a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) to an image sharpening task and observes the effects of Gibbs artifacts. This network has only one convolutional layer, which consists of four channels. The well-known rectified linear unit (ReLU) is used as the nonlinear activation function.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For simple one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D), unrealistic case studies, the Gibbs artifacts are completely removed. The reason why the artifacts can be removed is explained.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This simple case study illustrates the power of nonlinear functions and the use of multiple channels. In fact, this task can be achieved without using a neural network.",0
"Computer vision has become a powerful tool in the field of biosensing, aiding in the development of innovative and precise systems for the analysis and interpretation of biological data. This interdisciplinary approach harnesses the capabilities of computer vision algorithms and techniques to extract valuable information from various biosensing applications, including medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food health. Despite years of development, there is still significant room for improvement in this area. In this perspective, we outline how computer vision is applied to raw sensor data in biosensors and its advantages to biosensing applications. We then discuss ongoing research and developments in the field and subsequently explore the challenges and opportunities that computer vision faces in biosensor applications. We also suggest directions for future work, ultimately underscoring the significant impact of computer vision on advancing biosensing technologies and their applications.",0
"Machine learning (ML) already accelerates discoveries in many scientific fields and is the driver behind several new products. Recently, growing sample sizes enabled the use of ML approaches in larger omics studies. This work provides a guide through a typical analysis of an omics dataset using ML. As an example, this chapter demonstrates how to build a model predicting Drug-Induced Liver Injury based on transcriptomics data contained in the LINCS L1000 dataset. Each section covers best practices and pitfalls starting from data exploration and model training including hyperparameter search to validation and analysis of the final model.

"Background:
        
      
      Modern medical imaging modalities used by clinicians have many applications in the diagnosis of complicated diseases. These imaging technologies reveal the internal anatomy and physiology of the body. The fundamental idea behind medical image fusion is to increase the image's global and local contrast, enhance the visual impact, and change its format so that it is better suited for computer processing or human viewing while preventing noise magnification and accomplishing excellent real-time performance.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The top goal is to combine data from various modal images (CT/MRI and MR-T1/MR-T2) into a solitary image that, to the greatest degree possible, retains the key characteristics (prominent features) of the source images.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The clinical accuracy of medical issues is compromised because innumerable classical fusion methods struggle to conserve all the prominent features of the original images. Furthermore, complex implementation, high computation time, and more memory requirements are key problems of transform domain methods. With the purpose of solving these problems, this research suggests a fusion framework for multimodal medical images that makes use of a multi-scale edge-preserving filter and visual saliency detection. The source images are decomposed using a two-scale edge-preserving filter into base and detail layers. Base layers are combined using the addition fusion rule, while detail layers are fused using weight maps constructed using the maximum symmetric surround saliency detection algorithm.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The resultant image constructed by the presumed method has improved objective evaluation metrics than other classical methods, as well as unhindered edge contour, more global contrast, and no ringing effect or artifacts.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The methodology offers a dominant and symbiotic arsenal of clinical symptomatic, therapeutic, and biomedical research competencies that have the prospective to considerably strengthen medical practice and biological understanding.",0
"The shortage of data scientists has restricted the implementation of big data analytics in healthcare facilities. This survey study explores big data tool and technology usage, examines the gap between the supply and the demand for data scientists through Diffusion of Innovations theory, proposes engaging academics to accelerate knowledge diffusion, and recommends adoption of curriculum-building models. For this study, data were collected through a national survey of healthcare managers. Results provide practical data on big data tool and technology skills utilized in the workplace. This information is valuable for healthcare organizations, academics, and industry leaders who collaborate to implement the necessary infrastructure for content delivery and for experiential learning. It informs academics working to reengineer their curriculum to focus on big data analytics. The paper presents numerous resources that provide guidance for building knowledge. Future research directions are discussed.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Type II workplace violence in health care, perpetrated by patients/clients toward home healthcare nurses, is a serious health and safety issue. A significant portion of violent incidents are not officially reported. Natural language processing can detect these ""hidden cases"" from clinical notes. In this study, we computed the 12-month prevalence of Type II workplace violence from home healthcare nurses' clinical notes by developing and utilizing a natural language processing system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Nearly 600,000 clinical visit notes from two large U.S.-based home healthcare agencies were analyzed. The notes were recorded from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. Rule- and machine-learning-based natural language processing algorithms were applied to identify clinical notes containing workplace violence descriptions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The natural language processing algorithms identified 236 clinical notes that included Type II workplace violence toward home healthcare nurses. The prevalence of physical violence was 0.067 incidents per 10,000 home visits. The prevalence of nonphysical violence was 3.76 incidents per 10,000 home visits. The prevalence of any violence was four incidents per 10,000 home visits. In comparison, no Type II workplace violence incidents were recorded in the official incident report systems of the two agencies in this same time period.
    


          Conclusions and application to practice:
        
      
      Natural language processing can be an effective tool to augment formal reporting by capturing violence incidents from daily, ongoing, large volumes of clinical notes. It can enable managers and clinicians to stay informed of potential violence risks and keep their practice environment safe.",0
"Developmental biology has grown into a data intensive science with the development of high-throughput imaging and multi-omics approaches. Machine learning is a versatile set of techniques that can help make sense of these large datasets with minimal human intervention, through tasks such as image segmentation, super-resolution microscopy and cell clustering. In this Spotlight, I introduce the key concepts, advantages and limitations of machine learning, and discuss how these methods are being applied to problems in developmental biology. Specifically, I focus on how machine learning is improving microscopy and single-cell 'omics' techniques and data analysis. Finally, I provide an outlook for the futures of these fields and suggest ways to foster new interdisciplinary developments.",0
"Accessibility of powerful computers and availability of so-called big data from a variety of sources means that data science approaches are becoming pervasive. However, their application in mental health research is often considered to be at an earlier stage than in other areas despite the complexity of mental health and illness making such a sophisticated approach particularly suitable. In this Perspective, we discuss current and potential applications of data science in mental health research using the UK Clinical Research Collaboration classification: underpinning research; aetiology; detection and diagnosis; treatment development; treatment evaluation; disease management; and health services research. We demonstrate that data science is already being widely applied in mental health research, but there is much more to be done now and in the future. The possibilities for data science in mental health research are substantial.",0
"The current proliferation of mobile robots spans ecological monitoring, warehouse management and extreme environment exploration, to an individual consumer's home1-4. This expanding frontier of applications requires robots to transit multiple environments, a substantial challenge that traditional robot design strategies have not effectively addressed5,6. For example, biomimetic design-copying an animal's morphology, propulsion mechanism and gait-constitutes one approach, but it loses the benefits of engineered materials and mechanisms that can be exploited to surpass animal performance7,8. Other approaches add a unique propulsive mechanism for each environment to the same robot body, which can result in energy-inefficient designs9-11. Overall, predominant robot design strategies favour immutable structures and behaviours, resulting in systems incapable of specializing across environments12,13. Here, to achieve specialized multi-environment locomotion through terrestrial, aquatic and the in-between transition zones, we implemented 'adaptive morphogenesis', a design strategy in which adaptive robot morphology and behaviours are realized through unified structural and actuation systems. Taking inspiration from terrestrial and aquatic turtles, we built a robot that fuses traditional rigid components and soft materials to radically augment the shape of its limbs and shift its gaits for multi-environment locomotion. The interplay of gait, limb shape and the environmental medium revealed vital parameters that govern the robot's cost of transport. The results attest that adaptive morphogenesis is a powerful method to enhance the efficiency of mobile robots encountering unstructured, changing environments.",0
"Building and analyzing knowledge graphs (KGs) to aid drug discovery is a topical area of research. A salient feature of KGs is their ability to combine many heterogeneous data sources in a format that facilitates discovering connections. The utility of KGs has been exemplified in areas such as drug repurposing, with insights made through manual exploration and modeling of the data. In this chapter, we discuss promises and pitfalls of using natural language processing (NLP) to mine ""unstructured text""- typically from scientific literature- as a data source for KGs. This draws on our experience of initially parsing ""structured"" data sources-such as ChEMBL-as the basis for data within a KG, and then enriching or expanding upon them using NLP. The fundamental promise of NLP for KGs is the automated extraction of data from millions of documents-a task practically impossible to do via human curation alone. However, there are many potential pitfalls in NLP-KG pipelines, such as incorrect named entity recognition and ontology linking, all of which could ultimately lead to erroneous inferences and conclusions.",0
"Data analysis and their application are the unavoidable factors in the activities analyses in health care. Unfortunately, the acquisition of data from large available medical databases is a complex process and requires deep knowledge of computer science and especially knowledge of tools for data management. According to the European General Data Protection Regulation, the problem becomes much more complex. Recognizing these problems and difficulties, we have developed a Data Science Learning Platform (DSLP) that primarily targets practitioners and researchers but also the computer science students. Using our proposed tool chain together with the developed graphical user interface, data scientists and research physicians will be able to use available medical databases, apply and analyze different anonymization methods, analyze data according to the patient's risk and quickly formulate new studies to target a disease in a complex data model. This article presents a clinical research discovery toolbox that implements and demonstrates tools for data anonymization, patient data visualization, NLP-tools for guideline search and data science learning tools.",0
"Interest in machine-learning applications within medicine has been growing, but few studies have progressed to deployment in patient care.

"For thousands of years, robots have inspired the imagination of humans, but it was only about 35 years ago that a robot was used for the first time in medicine. Since then, robot-assisted procedures have become increasingly popular in urology, general surgical specialties, and gynecology. Robot-assisted vascular surgery was first introduced in 2002 and was thought to overcome the limitations of laparoscopy. However, it did not gain widespread popularity, and its usage is still limited to a few centers worldwide. Robot-assisted endovascular procedures, on the other hand, while still in its infancy, have become a promising alternative to existing techniques. The improvements of the robotic systems promote better surgical performance and reduce occupational hazards for vascular and endovascular surgeons. A comprehensive review of literature was performed using the search terms ""robotic,"" ""robot assisted,"" ""vascular surgery,"" and ""aortic"" for surgical procedures or ""robotic,"" ""robot assisted,"" and ""endovascular"" for endovascular procedures. Full text articles that were published between January 1990 and March 2021 were included. This review summarizes the development of the techniques for robot-assisted vascular and endovascular surgery in recent years, its outcomes, advantages, disadvantages, and perspectives.",0

"Technological advances in the real-time visualization of cutaneous microcirculation aim to realize benefits including high-resolution imaging, suppressed noise, and robust temporal coherence. Photoplethysmography (PPG), a noninvasive technique that measures single or multiple points of relative blood volume changes in blood vessels under the skin, shows potential as a signal candidate for visualizing blood vessels and tracking blood flow. However, challenges still remain, such as extracting/image reconstruction of the blood vessel/flow signal in a precise frequency window (<0.2 Hz) from a noisy image that is caused by the loss of spatial coherence of the light source in a turbid biological tissue. We attempted to overcome this challenge by adopting a combination of direct-contact-type, lens-less, conformable imagers and singular value decomposition (SVD) in this study. We focused on the numerical analysis of SVD for discriminating the tissue and vein blood flow in PPG for reconstructing blood fluidic images, followed by a complete demonstration of skin microcirculation blood tracking in the vessel visualization process when applying our lens-less, conformable, wearable imagers.",0
"The number of 'small' molecules that may be of interest to chemical biologists - chemical space - is enormous, but the fraction that have ever been made is tiny. Most strategies are discriminative, i.e. have involved 'forward' problems (have molecule, establish properties). However, we normally wish to solve the much harder generative or inverse problem (describe desired properties, find molecule). 'Deep' (machine) learning based on large-scale neural networks underpins technologies such as computer vision, natural language processing, driverless cars, and world-leading performance in games such as Go; it can also be applied to the solution of inverse problems in chemical biology. In particular, recent developments in deep learning admit the in silico generation of candidate molecular structures and the prediction of their properties, thereby allowing one to navigate (bio)chemical space intelligently. These methods are revolutionary but require an understanding of both (bio)chemistry and computer science to be exploited to best advantage. We give a high-level (non-mathematical) background to the deep learning revolution, and set out the crucial issue for chemical biology and informatics as a two-way mapping from the discrete nature of individual molecules to the continuous but high-dimensional latent representation that may best reflect chemical space. A variety of architectures can do this; we focus on a particular type known as variational autoencoders. We then provide some examples of recent successes of these kinds of approach, and a look towards the future.",0
"The development of medical applications of machine learning has required manual annotation of data, often by medical experts. Yet, the availability of large-scale unannotated data provides opportunities for the development of better machine-learning models. In this Review, we highlight self-supervised methods and models for use in medicine and healthcare, and discuss the advantages and limitations of their application to tasks involving electronic health records and datasets of medical images, bioelectrical signals, and sequences and structures of genes and proteins. We also discuss promising applications of self-supervised learning for the development of models leveraging multimodal datasets, and the challenges in collecting unbiased data for their training. Self-supervised learning may accelerate the development of medical artificial intelligence.",0
"The democratization of machine learning is a popular and growing movement. In a world with a wealth of publicly available data, it is important that algorithms for analysis of data are accessible and usable by everyone. We present MLpronto, a system for machine learning analysis that is designed to be easy to use so as to facilitate engagement with machine learning algorithms. With its web interface, MLpronto requires no computer programming or machine learning background, and it normally returns results in a matter of seconds. As input, MLpronto takes a file of data to be analyzed. MLpronto then executes some of the more commonly used supervised machine learning algorithms on the data and reports the results of the analyses. As part of its execution, MLpronto generates computer programming code corresponding to its machine learning analysis, which it also supplies as output. Thus, MLpronto can be used as a no-code solution for citizen data scientists with no machine learning or programming background, as an educational tool for those learning about machine learning, and as a first step for those who prefer to engage with programming code in order to facilitate rapid development of machine learning projects. MLpronto is freely available for use at https://mlpronto.org/.",0
"Reward and punishment have long been recognized as potent modulators of human behavior. Although reinforcement learning is a significant motor learning process, the exact mechanisms underlying how the brain learns movements through reward and punishment are not yet fully understood. Beyond the memory of specific examples, investigating the ability to generalize to new situations offers a better understanding of motor learning. This study hypothesizes that reward and punishment engage qualitatively different motivational systems with different neurochemical and neuroanatomical substrates, which would have differential effects on reinforcement-based motor learning and generalization. To test this hypothesis, two groups of participants learn a motor task in one direction and then relearn the same task in a new direction, receiving only performance-based reward or punishment score feedback. Our findings support our hypothesis, showing that reward led to slower learning but promoted generalization. On the other hand, punishment led to faster learning but impaired generalization. These behavioral differences may be due to different tendencies of movement variability in each group. The punishment group tended to explore more actively than the reward group during the initial learning phase, possibly due to loss aversion. In contrast, the reward group tended to explore more actively than the initial learning phase during the generalization test phase, seemingly recalling the strategy that led to the reward. These results suggest that reward and punishment may engage different neural mechanisms during reinforcement-based motor learning and generalization, with important implications for practical applications such as sports training and motor rehabilitation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although reinforcement learning is a significant motor learning process, the mechanisms underlying how the brain learns movements through reward and punishment are not fully understood. We modified a well-established motor adaptation task and used savings (faster relearning) to measure generalization. We found reward led to slower learning but promoted generalization, whereas punishment led to faster learning but impaired generalization, suggesting that reward and punishment may engage different neural mechanisms during reinforcement-based motor learning and generalization.",0

"Purpose of review:
        
      
      With the advancement of computational approaches and abundance of biomedical data, a broad range of neurodegenerative disease models have been developed. In this review, we argue that computational models can be both relevant and useful in neurodegenerative disease research and although the current established models have limitations in clinical practice, artificial intelligence has the potential to overcome deficiencies encountered by these models, which in turn can improve our understanding of disease.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      In recent years, diverse computational approaches have been used to shed light on different aspects of neurodegenerative disease models. For example, linear and nonlinear mixed models, self-modeling regression, differential equation models, and event-based models have been applied to provide a better understanding of disease progression patterns and biomarker trajectories. Additionally, the Cox-regression technique, Bayesian network models, and deep-learning-based approaches have been used to predict the probability of future incidence of disease, whereas nonnegative matrix factorization, nonhierarchical cluster analysis, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and deep-learning-based approaches have been employed to stratify patients based on their disease subtypes. Furthermore, the interpretation of neurodegenerative disease data is possible through knowledge-based models which use prior knowledge to complement data-driven analyses. These knowledge-based models can include pathway-centric approaches to establish pathways perturbed in a given condition, as well as disease-specific knowledge maps, which elucidate the mechanisms involved in a given disease. Collectively, these established models have revealed high granular details and insights into neurodegenerative disease models.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      In conjunction with increasingly advanced computational approaches, a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disease models, which can be broadly categorized into data-driven and knowledge-driven, have been developed. We review the state of the art data and knowledge-driven models and discuss the necessary steps which are vital to bring them into clinical application.",0
"Objectives: Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to improve aspects of healthcare. However, studies have shown that healthcare AI algorithms also have the potential to perpetuate existing inequities in healthcare, performing less effectively for marginalised populations. Studies on public attitudes towards AI outside of the healthcare field have tended to show higher levels of support for AI among socioeconomically advantaged groups that are less likely to be sufferers of algorithmic harms. We aimed to examine the sociodemographic predictors of support for scenarios related to healthcare AI.Methods: The Australian Values and Attitudes toward AI survey was conducted in March 2020 to assess Australians' attitudes towards AI in healthcare. An innovative weighting methodology involved weighting a non-probability web-based panel against results from a shorter omnibus survey distributed to a representative sample of Australians. We used multinomial logistic regression to examine the relationship between support for AI and a suite of sociodemographic variables in various healthcare scenarios.Results: Where support for AI was predicted by measures of socioeconomic advantage such as education, household income and Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas index, the same variables were not predictors of support for the healthcare AI scenarios presented. Variables associated with support for healthcare AI included being male, having computer science or programming experience and being aged between 18 and 34 years. Other Australian studies suggest that these groups may have a higher level of perceived familiarity with AI.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that while support for AI in general is predicted by indicators of social advantage, these same indicators do not predict support for healthcare AI.",0
"Previous studies have examined the maturation of learning and memory abilities during early stages of development. By comparison, much less is known about the ontogeny of learning and memory during later stages of development, including adolescence. In Experiment 1, we tested the ability of adolescent and adult rats to learn a Pavlovian negative occasion setting task. This procedure involves learning to inhibit a behavioral response when signaled by a cue in the environment. During reinforced trials, a target stimulus (a tone) was presented and immediately followed by a food reward. On nonreinforced trials, a feature stimulus (a light) was presented 5 sec prior to the tone and indicated the absence of reward following presentation of the tone. Both adult and adolescent rats learned to discriminate between two different trial types and withhold responding when the light preceded the tone. However, adolescent rats required more sessions than adults to discriminate between reinforced and nonreinforced trials. The results of Experiment 2 revealed that adolescents could learn the task rules but were specifically impaired in expressing that learning in the form of withholding behavior on nonreinforced trials. In Experiment 3, we found that adolescents were also impaired in learning a different version of the task in which the light and tone were presented simultaneously during the nonreinforced trials. These findings add to existing literature by indicating that impairments in inhibitory behavior during adolescence do not reflect an inability to learn to inhibit a response, but instead reflect a specific deficit in expressing that learning.",0
"Our ability to understand and control stem cell biology is being augmented by developments on two fronts, our ability to collect more data describing cell state and our capability to comprehend these data using deep learning models. Here we consider the impact deep learning will have in the future of stem cell research.

Achieving this will ensure that the resulting deep learning models are biologically meaningful and computationally tractable.",0
"Intelligent systems that are capable of making autonomous decisions based on input from their environment have great potential to do good, but they also raise significant social and ethical concerns. The discourse on ethics and artificial intelligence (AI) has covered these concerns in depth and developed an array of possible ways of addressing them. This article argues that a shortcoming of this discourse is that it concentrates on specific issues and their mitigation but neglects the nature of intelligent systems as socio-technical systems of systems that are often described as ecosystems. Building on the discussion of ethics and AI, the article suggests that it would be beneficial to come to an understanding of what would constitute responsible AI ecosystems. By introducing the concept of meta-responsibility or higher-level responsibility, the article proposes characteristics that an ecosystem would have to fulfil, in order to be considered a responsible ecosystem. This perspective is theoretically interesting because it extends the current AI ethics discourse. It furthermore offers a novel perspective for researchers and developers of intelligent system and helps them reflect on the way they relate to ethical issues.",0
"Process mining is a well-established discipline with applications in many industry sectors, including healthcare. To date, few publications have considered the context in which processes execute. Little consideration has been given as to how contextual data (exogenous data) can be practically included for process mining analysis, beyond including case or event attributes in a typical event log. We show that the combination of process data (endogenous) and exogenous data can generate insights not possible with standard process mining techniques. Our contributions are a framework for process mining with exogenous data and new analyses, where exogenous data and process behaviour are linked to process outcomes. Our new analyses visualise exogenous data, highlighting the trends and variations, to show where overlaps or distinctions exist between outcomes. We applied our analyses in a healthcare setting and show that clinicians could extract insights about differences in patients' vital signs (exogenous data) relevant to clinical outcomes. We present two evaluations, using a publicly available data set, MIMIC-III, to demonstrate the applicability of our analysis. These evaluations show that process mining can integrate large amounts of physiologic data and interventions, with resulting discrimination and conversion to clinically interpretable information.",0
"Due to the fast spread of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, surgical procedures have been changed essentially. The new techniques applied for both abdominal and thoracic procedures provided the possibility for minimally invasive access with all its advantages. Robots - originally developed for industrial applications - were retrofitted for laparoscopic procedures. The currently prevailing robot-assisted surgery is ergonomically more advantageous for the surgeon, as well as for the patient through the more precise preparative activity thanks to the regained 3D vision. The gradual decrease of costs of robotic surgical systems and development of new generations of minimally invasive devices may lead to substantial changes in routine surgical procedures.",0
"Aim: The aim of this review paper is to summarize recent developments and research in robotics, relevant to the field of ankle rehabilitation, to overview new findings and determine the actual state of the art.Method: The literature search was performed using scientific and medical databases (Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science) and other websites related to robots used in the area of ankle rehabilitation, analysing studies from 1950s to present. Information about the mechanical and kinematic specifications, actuation and stage of development was extracted from the selected literature.Results: Several types of rehabilitation robots have been considered, and they were classified depending on their architecture and design features. We we found that, regardless of the differences in architectures, only a few of them have been commercialized. The majority of rehabilitation robots designs allows plantarflexion-dorsiflexion movements. Unless some exceptions, most of the wearable robots do not allow the adduction-abduction movement. Neither the physical appearance of the robot nor the user's perception towards it has not regularly been taken into account in the design stage. This limits the possibility of successful commercialization.Conclusions: Up to the present moment, the main challenges in the field of robot rehabilitation are the lack of unique rehabilitation protocols capable to fulfil the needs of all types of patients and the additional resources to measure the effectiveness of proposals that have not yet been commercialized. Nonetheless, we have mentioned above three areas were the challenges in design are more pressing. The first one is the robot architecture, which still presents some incommodities nowadays to emulate the ankle joint movement in a natural way. Thus, the displacements experienced by the axes in the joint must be adaptable to each patient and a wide range of pathologies. Moreover, many proposals are not been conceived to the purpose of commercialization, and even less to become an object of personal use.Implications for rehabilitationThis review states that the use of robotic devices for ankle rehabilitation is a consolidated paradigm in the ankle's rehabilitation.Platform-based robots allow to do complex and specialized spatial movements and these architectures endow the device with high stiffness, a balanced force distribution and better adaptability to the mechanical properties of human ankle joints. Unless some exceptions, most of the wearable robots do not allow the adduction-abduction movement.For a full integration of these technologies in the ankle's rehabilitation field, more clinical evaluations are needed.Regardless of the potential of robotic devices in rehabilitation, only a few of them have been commercialized.",0
"As the healthcare community increasingly harnesses the power of generative artificial intelligence (AI), critical issues of security, privacy and regulation take centre stage. In this paper, we explore the security and privacy risks of generative AI from model-level and data-level perspectives. Moreover, we elucidate the potential consequences and case studies within the domain of ophthalmology. Model-level risks include knowledge leakage from the model and model safety under AI-specific attacks, while data-level risks involve unauthorised data collection and data accuracy concerns. Within the healthcare context, these risks can bear severe consequences, encompassing potential breaches of sensitive information, violating privacy rights and threats to patient safety. This paper not only highlights these challenges but also elucidates governance-driven solutions that adhere to AI and healthcare regulations. We advocate for preparedness against potential threats, call for transparency enhancements and underscore the necessity of clinical validation before real-world implementation. The objective of security and privacy improvement in generative AI warrants emphasising the role of ophthalmologists and other healthcare providers, and the timely introduction of comprehensive regulations.",0
"Context:
        
      
      Robotic surgery is rapidly evolving and has become an essential part of surgical practice in several parts of the world. Robotic technology will expand globally and most of the surgeons around the world will have access to surgical robots in the future. It is essential that we are updated about the outcomes of robot assisted surgeries which will allow everyone to develop an unbiased opinion on the clinical utility of this innovation.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      In this review we aim to present the evolution, objective evaluation of clinical outcomes and future perspectives of robot assisted urologic surgeries.
    


          Acquisition of evidence:
        
      
      A systematic literature review of clinical outcomes of robotic urological surgeries was made in the PUBMED. Randomized control trials, cohort studies and review articles were included. Moreover, a detailed search in the web based search engine was made to acquire information on evolution and evolving technologies in robotics.
    


          Synthesis of evidence:
        
      
      The present evidence suggests that the clinical outcomes of the robot assisted urologic surgeries are comparable to the conventional open surgical and laparoscopic results and are associated with fewer complications. However, long term results are not available for all the common robotic urologic surgeries. There are plenty of novel developments in robotics to be available for clinical use in the future.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robotic urologic surgery will continue to evolve in the future. We should continue to critically analyze whether the advances in technology and the higher cost eventually translates to improved overall surgical performance and outcomes.",0
"Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this article is to review the vision substitution devices based on computer vision and Image processing. The focus of this article is on reviewing devices that require coding and sensors mechanism.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Review of existing and commercially available vision assistive devices has been done. Comparison is based on feedback mechanics, adaptability in the surrounding environment, and functionality of devices. The study extended to advanced researches based on computer science and image processing. The integration of object detection and face recognition techniques in assistive devices for visually impaired in specific applications has been studied. Comparative analyses were presented.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The findings from this study suggest that a few assistive devices are available commercially. The commercially available assistive devices influenced by the mindsets of visually impaired and economical benefits. A combination of several devices can be fruitful in eliminating the limitation of an available device. Ample researches have been done for navigation, communication, object detection, and object recognition to assist visual impaired. The primary results might be promising, but most studies are not tested in actual conditions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Various assistive devices for visually impaired are available commercially and several studies indicate further advancement. However, adaptability and trustworthiness are major issues. The primary reason behind this is the low-performance level of the device, feedback, and testing. The secondary reason is commercial availability and poor knowledge of the end-user.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONAdvancement in computer science and image processing has paved the way to assist sensory impaired in doing various activities.Assistive technologies play a pivotal role in daily activities of visually impaired by assisting them for communication, and mobility.Assistive technologies can lead visually impaired to make them self-sustained.Very few research and devices related to assistive technology had reached the stage of testing and commercialization.Researchers can utilize the study in providing better assistive technology for the visually impaired.",0
"Computer vision has proven that it can solve many problems in the field of health in recent years. Processing the data obtained from the patients provided benefits in both disease detection and follow-up and control mechanisms. Studies on the use of computer vision for COVID-19, which is one of the biggest global health problems of the past years, are increasing daily. This study includes a preliminary review of COVID-19 computer vision research conducted in recent years. This review aims to help researchers who want to work in this field.",0
"Deep learning-based image processing is capable of creating highly appealing results. However, it is still widely considered as a ""blackbox"" transformation. In medical imaging, this lack of comprehensibility of the results is a sensitive issue. The integration of known operators into the deep learning environment has proven to be advantageous for the comprehensibility and reliability of the computations. Consequently, we propose the use of the locally linear guided filter in combination with a learned guidance map for general purpose medical image processing. The output images are only processed by the guided filter while the guidance map can be trained to be task-optimal in an end-to-end fashion. We investigate the performance based on two popular tasks: image super resolution and denoising. The evaluation is conducted based on pairs of multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging and cross-modal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging datasets. For both tasks, the proposed approach is on par with state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we can show that the input image's content is almost unchanged after the processing which is not the case for conventional deep learning approaches. On top, the proposed pipeline offers increased robustness against degraded input as well as adversarial attacks.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is taking centre stage in economic growth and business operations alike. Public discourse about the practical and ethical implications of AI has mainly focussed on the societal level. There is an emerging knowledge base on AI risks to human rights around data security and privacy concerns. A separate strand of work has highlighted the stresses of working in the gig economy. This prevailing focus on human rights and gig impacts has been at the expense of a closer look at how AI may be reshaping traditional workplace relations and, more specifically, workplace health and safety. To address this gap, we outline a conceptual model for developing an AI Work Health and Safety (WHS) Scorecard as a tool to assess and manage the potential risks and hazards to workers resulting from AI use in a workplace. A qualitative, practice-led research study of AI adopters was used to generate and test a novel list of potential AI risks to worker health and safety. Risks were identified after cross-referencing Australian AI Ethics Principles and Principles of Good Work Design with AI ideation, design and implementation stages captured by the AI Canvas, a framework otherwise used for assessing the commercial potential of AI to a business. The unique contribution of this research is the development of a novel matrix itemising currently known or anticipated risks to the WHS and ethical aspects at each AI adoption stage.",0
"In recent years, there has been massive progress in artificial intelligence (AI) with the development of deep neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision and robotics. These techniques are now actively being applied in healthcare with many of the health service activities currently being delivered by clinicians and administrators predicted to be taken over by AI in the coming years. However, there has also been exceptional hype about the abilities of AI with a mistaken notion that AI will replace human clinicians altogether. These perspectives are inaccurate, and if a balanced perspective of the limitations and promise of AI is taken, one can gauge which parts of the health system AI can be integrated to make a meaningful impact. The four main areas where AI would have the most influence would be: patient administration, clinical decision support, patient monitoring and healthcare interventions. This health system where AI plays a central role could be termed an AI-enabled or AI-augmented health system. In this article, we discuss how this system can be developed based on a realistic assessment of current AI technologies and predicted developments.",0
"Surgery performed by a novice neurosurgeon under constant supervision of a senior surgeon with the experience of thousands of operations, able to handle any intraoperative complications and predict them in advance, and never getting tired, is currently an elusive dream, but can become a reality with the development of artificial intelligence methods. This paper has presented a review of the literature on the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the microsurgical operating room. Searching for sources was carried out in the PubMed text database of medical and biological publications. The key words used were ""surgical procedures"", ""dexterity"", ""microsurgery"" AND ""artificial intelligence"" OR ""machine learning"" OR ""neural networks"". Articles in English and Russian were considered with no limitation to publication date. The main directions of research on the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the microsurgical operating room have been highlighted. Despite the fact that in recent years machine learning has been increasingly introduced into the medical field, a small number of studies related to the problem of interest have been published, and their results have not proved to be of practical use yet. However, the social significance of this direction is an important argument for its development.",0
"The effects of the response-reinforcer dependency on resistance to change were studied in three experiments with rats. In Experiment 1, lever pressing produced reinforcers at similar rates after variable interreinforcer intervals in each component of a two-component multiple schedule. Across conditions, in the fixed component, all reinforcers were response-dependent; in the alternative component, the percentage of response-dependent reinforcers was 100, 50 (i.e., 50% response-dependent and 50% response-independent) or 10% (i.e., 10% response-dependent and 90% response-independent). Resistance to extinction was greater in the alternative than in the fixed component when the dependency in the former was 10%, but was similar between components when this dependency was 100 or 50%. In Experiment 2, a three-component multiple schedule was used. The dependency was 100% in one component and 10% in the other two. The 10% components differed on how reinforcers were programmed. In one component, as in Experiment 1, a reinforcer had to be collected before the scheduling of other response-dependent or independent reinforcers. In the other component, response-dependent and -independent reinforcers were programmed by superimposing a variable-time schedule on an independent variable-interval schedule. Regardless of the procedure used to program the dependency, resistance to extinction was greater in the 10% components than in the 100% component. These results were replicated in Experiment 3 in which, instead of extinction, VT schedules replaced the baseline schedules in each multiple-schedule component during the test. We argue that the relative change in dependency from Baseline to Test, which is greater when baseline dependencies are high rather than low, could account for the differential resistance to change in the present experiments. The inconsistencies in results across the present and previous experiments suggest that the effects of dependency on resistance to change are not well understood. Additional systematic analyses are important to further understand the effects of the response-reinforcer relation on resistance to change and to the development of a more comprehensive theory of behavioral persistence.",0
"One class of theoretical accounts of associative learning suggests that reinforcers are processed according to learning rules that minimize the predictive error between the expected strength of future reinforcement and its actual strength. The omission of reinforcement in a situation where it is expected leads to inhibitory learning of stimuli indicative for such a violation of the prediction. There are, however, results indicating that inhibitory learning can also be induced by other mechanisms. Here, we present data from olfactory reward conditioning in honeybees that show that (1) one- and multiple-trial backward conditioning results in conditioned inhibition (CI); (2) the inhibition is maximal for a 15-sec interval between US and CS; (3) there is a nonmonotonic dependency on the degree of CI from the US-CS interval during backward pairing; and (4) the prior association of context stimuli with reinforcement is not necessary for the development of CI. These results cannot be explained by models that only minimize a prediction error. Rather, they are consistent with models of associative learning that, in addition, assume that learning depends on the temporal overlap of a CS with two processes, a fast excitatory and a slow inhibitory one, both evoked by a reinforcer. The fmdings from this behavioral analysis of reinforcement processing are compared with the known properties of an individual, identified neuron involved in reinforcement processing in the bee brain, to further understand the mechanisms underlying predictive reward learning.",0
"This article discusses the role of computer vision in otolaryngology, particularly through endoscopy and surgery. It covers recent applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in nonradiologic imaging within otolaryngology, noting the benefits and challenges, such as improving diagnostic accuracy and optimizing therapeutic outcomes, while also pointing out the necessity for enhanced data curation and standardized research methodologies to advance clinical applications. Technical aspects are also covered, providing a detailed view of the progression from manual feature extraction to more complex AI models, including convolutional neural networks and vision transformers and their potential application in clinical settings.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key component in diagnostic medical imaging, including echocardiography. AI with deep learning has already been used with automated view labeling, measurements, and interpretation. As the development and use of AI in echocardiography increase, potential concerns may be raised by cardiac sonographers and the profession. This report, from a sonographer's perspective, focuses on defining AI, the basics of the technology, identifying some current applications of AI, and how the use of AI may improve patient care in the future.",0
"The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in nuclear medicine and radiology has been accompanied by AI commentators and experts predicting that AI would make radiologists, in particular, extinct. More realistic perspectives suggest significant changes will occur in medical practice. There is no escaping the disruptive technology associated with AI, neural networks, and deep learning, the most significant perhaps since the early days of Roentgen, Becquerel, and Curie. AI is an omen, but it need not be foreshadowing a negative event; rather, it is heralding great opportunity. The key to sustainability lies not in resisting AI but in having a deep understanding and exploiting the capabilities of AI in nuclear medicine while mastering those capabilities unique to the human resources.",0
"Early de-risking of drug targets and chemistry is essential to provide drug projects with the best chance of success. Target safety assessments (TSAs) use target biology, gene and protein expression data, genetic information from humans and animals, and competitor compound intelligence to understand the potential safety risks associated with modulating a drug target. However, there is a vast amount of information, updated daily that must be considered for each TSA. We have developed a data science-based approach that allows acquisition of relevant evidence for an optimal TSA. This is built on expert-led conventional and artificial intelligence-based mining of literature and other bioinformatics databases. Potential safety risks are identified according to an evidence framework, adjusted to the degree of target novelty. Expert knowledge is necessary to interpret the evidence and to take account of the nuances of drug safety, the modality, and the intended patient population for each TSA within each project. Overall, TSAs take full advantage of the most recent developments in data science and can be used within drug projects to identify and mitigate risks, helping with informed decision-making and resource management. These approaches should be used in the earliest stages of a drug project to guide decisions such as target selection, discovery chemistry options, in vitro assay choice, and end points for investigative in vivo studies.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is often presented as a technology that changes healthcare and is useful in clinical work in disease prediction, diagnosis, treatment effectiveness, and precision health. This study aimed to explore healthcare leaders' perceptions of the usefulness of AI applications in clinical work. The study was based on qualitative content analysis. Individual interviews were conducted with 26 healthcare leaders. The usefulness of AI applications in clinical care was described in terms of expected benefits for 1) patients as supporting individualized self-management and person-centered information support tools 2) healthcare professionals in terms of providing decision-support in diagnostics, risk assessments, treatment recommendations, warning systems, and as a new colleague supporting the clinical work, and 3) organizations as providing patient safety and decision-support in prioritizing healthcare resources in organizing healthcare.",0
"This article introduces a tracked-leg transformable robot, TALBOT. The mechanical and electrical design, control method, and environment perception based on LiDAR are discussed. The original tracked-leg transformable structure allows the robot to switch between the tracked and legged mode to achieve all-terrain adaptation. In the tracked mode, TALBOT is controlled by the method of differential speed between the two tracked feet. In the legged mode, TALBOT is controlled based on a bionic control strategy of the central pattern generator to realize the generation and conversion of gait. In addition, the robot is equipped with a LiDAR, through sensor preprocessing and optimization of the slam mapping algorithm, so that the robot achieves a better mapping effect. We tested the robot's motion performance and the slam mapping effect, including going straight and turning in tracked and legged modes and building a map in an indoor environment.",0
"This article provides a selective review and integration of the behavioral literature on Pavlovian extinction. The first part reviews evidence that extinction does not destroy the original learning, but instead generates new learning that is especially context-dependent. The second part examines insights provided by research on several related behavioral phenomena (the interference paradigms, conditioned inhibition, and inhibition despite reinforcement). The final part examines four potential causes of extinction: the discrimination of a new reinforcement rate, generalization decrement, response inhibition, and violation of a reinforcer expectation. The data are consistent with behavioral models that emphasize the role of generalization decrement and expectation violation, but would be more so if those models were expanded to better accommodate the finding that extinction involves a context-modulated form of inhibitory learning.",0
"The medical literature has been growing exponentially, and its size has become a barrier for physicians to locate and extract clinically useful information. As a promising solution, natural language processing (NLP), especially machine learning (ML)-based NLP is a technology that potentially provides a promising solution. ML-based NLP is based on training a computational algorithm with a large number of annotated examples to allow the computer to ""learn"" and ""predict"" the meaning of human language. Although NLP has been widely applied in industry and business, most physicians still are not aware of the huge potential of this technology in medicine, and the implementation of NLP in breast cancer research and management is fairly limited. With a real-world successful project of identifying penetrance papers for breast and other cancer susceptibility genes, this review illustrates how to train and evaluate an NLP-based medical abstract classifier, incorporate it into a semiautomatic meta-analysis procedure, and validate the effectiveness of this procedure. Other implementations of NLP technology in breast cancer research, such as parsing pathology reports and mining electronic healthcare records, are also discussed. We hope this review will help breast cancer physicians and researchers to recognize, understand, and apply this technology to meet their own clinical or research needs.",0
"The invention of computer and advancement in information technology has revolutionized and benefited the society but at the same time has caused symptoms related to its usage such as ocular sprain, irritation, redness, dryness, blurred vision and double vision. This cluster of symptoms is known as computer vision syndrome which is characterized by the visual symptoms which result from interaction with computer display or its environment. Three major mechanisms that lead to computer vision syndrome are extraocular mechanism, accommodative mechanism and ocular surface mechanism. The visual effects of the computer such as brightness, resolution, glare and quality all are known factors that contribute to computer vision syndrome. Prevention is the most important strategy in managing computer vision syndrome. Modification in the ergonomics of the working environment, patient education and proper eye care are crucial in managing computer vision syndrome.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Machine learning (ML) is a growing field in medicine. This narrative review describes the current body of literature on ML for clinical decision support in infectious diseases (ID).
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      We aim to inform clinicians about the use of ML for diagnosis, classification, outcome prediction and antimicrobial management in ID.
    


          Sources:
        
      
      References for this review were identified through searches of MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, biorXiv, ACM Digital Library, arXiV and IEEE Xplore Digital Library up to July 2019.
    


          Content:
        
      
      We found 60 unique ML-clinical decision support systems (ML-CDSS) aiming to assist ID clinicians. Overall, 37 (62%) focused on bacterial infections, 10 (17%) on viral infections, nine (15%) on tuberculosis and four (7%) on any kind of infection. Among them, 20 (33%) addressed the diagnosis of infection, 18 (30%) the prediction, early detection or stratification of sepsis, 13 (22%) the prediction of treatment response, four (7%) the prediction of antibiotic resistance, three (5%) the choice of antibiotic regimen and two (3%) the choice of a combination antiretroviral therapy. The ML-CDSS were developed for intensive care units (n = 24, 40%), ID consultation (n = 15, 25%), medical or surgical wards (n = 13, 20%), emergency department (n = 4, 7%), primary care (n = 3, 5%) and antimicrobial stewardship (n = 1, 2%). Fifty-three ML-CDSS (88%) were developed using data from high-income countries and seven (12%) with data from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The evaluation of ML-CDSS was limited to measures of performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity) for 57 ML-CDSS (95%) and included data in clinical practice for three (5%).
    


          Implications:
        
      
      Considering comprehensive patient data from socioeconomically diverse healthcare settings, including primary care and LMICs, may improve the ability of ML-CDSS to suggest decisions adapted to various clinical contexts. Currents gaps identified in the evaluation of ML-CDSS must also be addressed in order to know the potential impact of such tools for clinicians and patients.",0
"People are paying greater attention to their personal health as society develops and progresses, and rheumatic immunological disorders have become a serious concern that affects human health. As a result, research on a stable, trustworthy, and effective auxiliary diagnostic method for rheumatic immune disorders is critical. Machine learning overcomes the inefficiencies and volatility of human data processing, ushering in a revolution in artificial intelligence research. With the use of big data, machine learning-based application research on rheumatic immunological disorders has already demonstrated detection abilities that are on par with or better than those of medical professionals. Artificial intelligence systems are now being applied in the field of rheumatic immune disorders, with an emphasis on the identification of patient joint images. This article focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms in the diagnosis of rheumatic illnesses, as well as the practical implications of disease-assisted diagnosis systems and intelligent medical diagnosis. This article focuses on three common machine learning algorithms for research and debate: logistic regression, support vector machines, and adaptive boosting techniques. The three algorithms are used to build diagnostic models based on rheumatic illness data, and the performance of each model is assessed. According to a thorough analysis of the assessment data, the diagnostic model based on the limit gradient boosting method has the best resilience. This article presents machine learning's use and advancement in rheumatic immunological disorders, as well as new ideas for investigating more appropriate and efficient diagnostic and treatment techniques.",0
"As one of the critical branches of medical image processing, the task of segmentation of breast cancer tumors is of great importance for planning surgical interventions, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Breast cancer tumor segmentation faces several challenges, including the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of breast tissue, the presence of various imaging artifacts and noise in medical images, low contrast between the tumor region and healthy tissue, and inconsistent size of the tumor region. Furthermore, the existing segmentation methods may not fully capture the rich spatial and contextual information in small-sized regions in breast images, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel breast tumor segmentation method, called the transformer and graph convolutional neural (TS-GCN) network, for medical imaging analysis. Specifically, we designed a feature aggregation network to fuse the features extracted from the transformer, GCN and convolutional neural network (CNN) networks. The CNN extract network is designed for the image's local deep feature, and the transformer and GCN networks can better capture the spatial and context dependencies among pixels in images. By leveraging the strengths of three feature extraction networks, our method achieved superior segmentation performance on the BUSI dataset and dataset B. The TS-GCN showed the best performance on several indexes, with Acc of 0.9373, Dice of 0.9058, IoU of 0.7634, F1 score of 0.9338, and AUC of 0.9692, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The research of this segmentation method provides a promising future for medical image analysis and diagnosis of other diseases.",0
"In medical image segmentation, it is often necessary to collect opinions from multiple experts to make the final decision. This clinical routine helps to mitigate individual bias. However, when data is annotated by multiple experts, standard deep learning models are often not applicable. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network framework called Multi-rater Prism (MrPrism) to learn medical image segmentation from multiple labels. Inspired by iterative half-quadratic optimization, MrPrism combines the task of assigning multi-rater confidences and calibrated segmentation in a recurrent manner. During this process, MrPrism learns inter-observer variability while taking into account the image's semantic properties and finally converges to a self-calibrated segmentation result reflecting inter-observer agreement. Specifically, we propose Converging Prism (ConP) and Diverging Prism (DivP) to iteratively process the two tasks. ConP learns calibrated segmentation based on multi-rater confidence maps estimated by DivP, and DivP generates multi-rater confidence maps based on segmentation masks estimated by ConP. Experimental results show that the two tasks can mutually improve each other through this recurrent process. The final converged segmentation result of MrPrism outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for a wide range of medical image segmentation tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/WuJunde/MrPrism.",0
"Demand for big-data scientists continues to escalate driving a pressing need for new graduates to be more fluent in the big-data skills needed by employers. If a gap exists between the educational knowledge held by graduates and big data workplace skills needed to produce results, workers will be unable to address the big data needs of employers. This survey explores big-data skills in the classroom and those required in the workplace to determine if a skills gap exists for big-data scientists. In this work, data was collected using a national survey of healthcare professionals. Participant responses were analyzed to inform curriculum development, providing valuable information for academics and the industry leaders who hire new data talent.",0
"It feels rewarding to ace your opponent on match point. Here, we propose common mechanisms underlie reward and performance learning. First, when a singing bird unexpectedly hits the right note, its dopamine (DA) neurons are activated as when a thirsty monkey receives an unexpected juice reward. Second, these DA signals reinforce vocal variations much as they reinforce stimulus-response associations. Third, limbic inputs to DA neurons signal the predicted quality of song syllables much like they signal the predicted reward value of a place or a stimulus during foraging. Finally, songbirds may solve difficult problems in reinforcement learning - such as credit assignment and catastrophic forgetting - with node perturbation and consolidation of reinforced vocal patterns in motor cortical circuits. Consolidation occurs downstream of a canonical 'actor-critic' circuit motif that learns to maximize performance quality in essentially the same way it learns to maximize reward: by computing and learning from prediction errors.",0
"Carbon capturing is imperative to fight climate change as much carbon emissions are liberated into the atmosphere, leading to adversely negative environmental impacts. Today's world addresses all the issues with the aid of digital technologies like data pooling and artificial intelligence (AI). Accordingly, this study is articulated based on AI-assisted carbon capturing. Techniques including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid techniques being adopted in carbon capture are discussed. The role of AI tools, frameworks, and mathematical models are also discussed herein. Furthermore, the confluence of AI in carbon capture patent landscape is explored. This study would allow researchers to envision the growth of AI-assisted carbon capture in mitigating climate change and meeting SDG 13 - climate action.",0
"Humans can learn tasks explicitly, as they can often describe the rules they have used to learn the task.1,2,3 Animals, however, are thought to learn tasks implicitly (i.e., purely associatively).2,3 That is, they gradually learn the correlation or association between the stimulus (or response) and the outcome. Both humans and pigeons can learn matching, where a sample stimulus indicates which one of two stimuli matches the sample. The 1-back reinforcement task is a difficult version of matching in which a correct response on trial N is rewarded only following a response on trial N + 1 (independent of the response on trial N + 1),4 and the correct response on trial N + 1 indicates whether a reward will occur on trial N + 2, and so forth. Humans do not appear to be able to learn the 1-back rule.5 Pigeons, however, do show 1-back reinforcement learning,6,7 and they appear to do so implicitly by gradually learning the correlation between their response on one trial and the outcome on the next trial (because all other relations are uncorrelated with the outcome). They learn the task slowly and to a level below what would be expected had they learned it explicitly. The present results, together with research with humans,7 suggest that there are times when human explicit learning may interfere with the ability of humans to learn. Pigeons, however, are not ""distracted"" by attempts at explicit learning, and thus they are able to learn this and other similar tasks.6,7,8.",0
"Natural language processing (NLP), a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that models human language, has been used in medicine to automate diagnostics, detect adverse events, support decision making and predict clinical outcomes. However, applications to the clinical neurosciences appear to be limited. NLP has matured with the implementation of deep transformer models (e.g., XLNet, BERT, T5, and RoBERTa) and transfer learning. The objectives of this study were to (1) systematically review NLP applications in the clinical neurosciences, and (2) explore NLP analysis to facilitate literature synthesis, providing clear examples to demonstrate the potential capabilities of these technologies for a clinical audience. Our NLP analysis consisted of keyword identification, text summarization and document classification. A total of 48 articles met inclusion criteria. NLP has been applied in the clinical neurosciences to facilitate literature synthesis, data extraction, patient identification, automated clinical reporting and outcome prediction. The number of publications applying NLP has increased rapidly over the past five years. Document classifiers trained to differentiate included and excluded articles demonstrated moderate performance (XLNet AUC = 0.66, BERT AUC = 0.59, RoBERTa AUC = 0.62). The T5 transformer model generated acceptable abstract summaries. The application of NLP has the potential to enhance research and practice in the clinical neurosciences.",0
"External content sources such as MEDLINE(®), National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants and conference websites provide access to the latest breaking biomedical information, which can inform pharmaceutical and biotechnology company pipeline decisions. The value of the sites for industry, however, is limited by the use of the public internet, the limited synonyms, the rarity of batch searching capability and the disconnected nature of the sites. Fortunately, many sites now offer their content for download and we have developed an automated internal workflow that uses text mining and tailored ontologies for programmatic search and knowledge extraction. We believe such an efficient and secure approach provides a competitive advantage to companies needing access to the latest information for a range of use cases and complements manually curated commercial sources.",0
"Augmented reality (AR) is an environment-enhancing technology, widely applied in the computer sciences, which has only recently begun to permeate the medical field. Gastrointestinal endoscopy-which relies on the integration of high-definition video data with pathologic correlates-requires endoscopists to assimilate and process a tremendous amount of data in real time. We believe that AR is well positioned to provide computer-guided assistance with a wide variety of endoscopic applications, beginning with polyp detection. In this article, we review the principles of AR, describe its potential integration into an endoscopy set-up, and envisage a series of novel uses. With close collaboration between physicians and computer scientists, AR promises to contribute significant improvements to the field of endoscopy.",0
"Over the last decade, there has been a large amount of research on technology-enhanced learning (TEL), including the exploration of sensor-based technologies. This research area has seen significant contributions from various conferences, including the European Conference on Technology-Enhanced Learning (EC-TEL). In this research, we present a comprehensive analysis that aims to identify and understand the evolving topics in the TEL area and their implications in defining the future of education. To achieve this, we use a novel methodology that combines a text-analytics-driven topic analysis and a social network analysis following an open science approach. We collected a comprehensive corpus of 477 papers from the last decade of the EC-TEL conference (including full and short papers), parsed them automatically, and used the extracted text to find the main topics and collaborative networks across papers. Our analysis focused on the following three main objectives: (1) Discovering the main topics of the conference based on paper keywords and topic modeling using the full text of the manuscripts. (2) Discovering the evolution of said topics over the last ten years of the conference. (3) Discovering how papers and authors from the conference have interacted over the years from a network perspective. Specifically, we used Python and PdfToText library to parse and extract the text and author keywords from the corpus. Moreover, we employed Gensim library Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to discover the primary topics from the last decade. Finally, Gephi and Networkx libraries were used to create co-authorship and citation networks. Our findings provide valuable insights into the latest trends and developments in educational technology, underlining the critical role of sensor-driven technologies in leading innovation and shaping the future of this area.",0
"Deep learning for computer vision has shown promising results in the field of entomology, however, there still remains untapped potential. Deep learning performance is enabled primarily by large quantities of annotated data which, outside of rare circumstances, are limited in ecological studies. Currently, to utilize deep learning systems, ecologists undergo extensive data collection efforts, or limit their problem to niche tasks. These solutions do not scale to region agnostic models. However, there are solutions that employ data augmentation, simulators, generative models, and self-supervised learning that can supplement limited labelled data. Here, we highlight the success of deep learning for computer vision within entomology, discuss data collection efforts, provide methodologies for optimizing learning from limited annotations, and conclude with practical guidelines for how to achieve a foundation model for entomology capable of accessible automated ecological monitoring on a global scale.",0
"As the amount and complexity of biomedical data continue to increase, machine learning methods are becoming a popular tool in creating prediction models for the underlying biomedical processes. Although all machine learning methods aim to fit models to data, the methodologies used can vary greatly and may seem daunting at first. A comprehensive review of various machine learning algorithms per biomedical applications is presented. The key concepts of machine learning are supervised and unsupervised learning, feature selection, and evaluation metrics. Technical insights on the major machine learning methods such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors are analyzed. Next, the dimensionality reduction methods like principal component analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding methods, and their applications in biomedical data analysis were reviewed. Moreover, in biomedical applications predominantly feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks are utilized. In addition, the identification of emerging directions in machine learning methodology will serve as a useful reference for individuals involved in biomedical research, clinical practice, and related professions who are interested in understanding and applying machine learning algorithms in their research or practice.",0
"The increasing number of applications of three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids as an in vitro model for drug discovery requires their adaptation to large-scale screening formats in every step of a drug screen, including large-scale image analysis. Currently there is no ready-to-use and free image analysis software to meet this large-scale format. Most existing methods involve manually drawing the length and width of the imaged 3D spheroids, which is a tedious and time-consuming process. This study presents a high-throughput image analysis software application - SpheroidSizer, which measures the major and minor axial length of the imaged 3D tumor spheroids automatically and accurately; calculates the volume of each individual 3D tumor spheroid; then outputs the results in two different forms in spreadsheets for easy manipulations in the subsequent data analysis. The main advantage of this software is its powerful image analysis application that is adapted for large numbers of images. It provides high-throughput computation and quality-control workflow. The estimated time to process 1,000 images is about 15 min on a minimally configured laptop, or around 1 min on a multi-core performance workstation. The graphical user interface (GUI) is also designed for easy quality control, and users can manually override the computer results. The key method used in this software is adapted from the active contour algorithm, also known as Snakes, which is especially suitable for images with uneven illumination and noisy background that often plagues automated imaging processing in high-throughput screens. The complimentary ""Manual Initialize"" and ""Hand Draw"" tools provide the flexibility to SpheroidSizer in dealing with various types of spheroids and diverse quality images. This high-throughput image analysis software remarkably reduces labor and speeds up the analysis process. Implementing this software is beneficial for 3D tumor spheroids to become a routine in vitro model for drug screens in industry and academia.",0
"This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) about realistic simulators that can be applied in an educational robotics context. These simulators must include the simulation of actuators and sensors, the ability to simulate robots and their environment. During this systematic review of the literature, 559 articles were extracted from six different databases using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Context (PICOC) method. After the selection process, 50 selected articles were included in this review. Several simulators were found and their features were also analyzed. As a result of this process, four realistic simulators were applied in the review's referred context for two main reasons. The first reason is that these simulators have high fidelity in the robots' visual modeling due to the 3D rendering engines and the second reason is because they apply physics engines, allowing the robot's interaction with the environment.",0
"In response to growing recognition of the social impacts of new artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies, major AI and machine learning (ML) conferences and journals now encourage or require papers to include ethics impact statements and undergo ethics reviews. This move has sparked heated debate concerning the role of ethics in AI research, at times devolving into name calling and threats of ""cancellation."" We diagnose this conflict as one between ""atomist"" and ""holist"" ideologies. Among other things, atomists believe facts are and should be kept separate from values, while holists believe facts and values are and should be inextricable from one another. With the goal of reducing disciplinary polarization, we draw on numerous philosophical and historical sources to describe each ideology's core beliefs and assumptions. Finally, we call on atomists and holists within the ever-expanding data science community to exhibit greater empathy during ethical disagreements and propose four targeted strategies to ensure AI research benefits society.",0
"This study proposed the necessity of identifying the sampling sites for Boletus tomentipes (B.tomentipes) in combination with cadmium content and environmental factors. Based on fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (FT-MIR) preprocessing by 1st, 2nd, MSC, SNV and SG, five machine learning (ML) algorithms (NB, DT, KNN, RF, SVM) and three Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) were built. To avoid complex preprocessing, we construct BoletusResnet model, propose the concepts of 3DCOS, 3DCOS projected images, index images in addition to 2DCOS, and combine them with deep learning (DL) for classification for the first time. It shows that GBM has higher accuracy than ML and DL has better accuracy than GBM. The four DL models presented in this paper achieve fine-grained sampling sites recognition based on small samples with 100 % accuracy, and a computer application system was developed on them. Therefore, spectral image processing combined with DL is a rapid and efficient classification method which can be widely used in food identification.",0
"Machine learning and more recently deep learning have become valuable tools in clinical decision making for neonatal seizure detection. This work proposes a deep neural network architecture which is capable of extracting information from long segments of EEG. Residual connections as well as data augmentation and a more robust optimizer are efficiently exploited to train a deeper architecture with an increased receptive field and longer EEG input. The proposed system is tested on a large clinical dataset of 4,570 hours of duration and benchmarked on a publicly available Helsinki dataset of 112 hours duration. The performance has improved from an AUC of 95.41% to an AUC of 97.73% when compared to a deep learning baseline.",0
"Deep learning is rapidly becoming the technique of choice for automated segmentation of nuclei in biological image analysis workflows. In order to evaluate the feasibility of training nuclear segmentation models on small, custom annotated image datasets that have been augmented, we have designed a computational pipeline to systematically compare different nuclear segmentation model architectures and model training strategies. Using this approach, we demonstrate that transfer learning and tuning of training parameters, such as the composition, size, and preprocessing of the training image dataset, can lead to robust nuclear segmentation models, which match, and often exceed, the performance of existing, off-the-shelf deep learning models pretrained on large image datasets. We envision a practical scenario where deep learning nuclear segmentation models trained in this way can be shared across a laboratory, facility, or institution, and continuously improved by training them on progressively larger and varied image datasets. Our work provides computational tools and a practical framework for deep learning-based biological image segmentation using small annotated image datasets. Published [2020]. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, together with the availability of big data in society, creates uncertainties about how these developments will affect healthcare systems worldwide. Compassion is essential for high-quality healthcare and research shows how prosocial caring behaviors benefit human health and societies. However, the possible association between AI technologies and compassion is under conceptualized and underexplored.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive depth and a balanced perspective of the emerging topic of AI technologies and compassion, to inform future research and practice. The review questions were: How is compassion discussed in relation to AI technologies in healthcare? How are AI technologies being used to enhance compassion in healthcare? What are the gaps in current knowledge and unexplored potential? What are the key areas where AI technologies could support compassion in healthcare?
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A systematic scoping review following five steps of Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Presentation of the scoping review conforms with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Eligibility criteria were defined according to 3 concept constructs (AI technologies, compassion, healthcare) developed from the literature and informed by medical subject headings (MeSH) and key words for the electronic searches. Sources of evidence were Web of Science and PubMed databases, articles published in English language 2011-2022. Articles were screened by title/abstract using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data extracted (author, date of publication, type of article, aim/context of healthcare, key relevant findings, country) was charted using data tables. Thematic analysis used an inductive-deductive approach to generate code categories from the review questions and the data. A multidisciplinary team assessed themes for resonance and relevance to research and practice.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Searches identified 3,124 articles. A total of 197 were included after screening. The number of articles has increased over 10 years (2011, n = 1 to 2021, n = 47 and from Jan-Aug 2022 n = 35 articles). Overarching themes related to the review questions were: (1) Developments and debates (7 themes) Concerns about AI ethics, healthcare jobs, and loss of empathy; Human-centered design of AI technologies for healthcare; Optimistic speculation AI technologies will address care gaps; Interrogation of what it means to be human and to care; Recognition of future potential for patient monitoring, virtual proximity, and access to healthcare; Calls for curricula development and healthcare professional education; Implementation of AI applications to enhance health and wellbeing of the healthcare workforce. (2) How AI technologies enhance compassion (10 themes) Empathetic awareness; Empathetic response and relational behavior; Communication skills; Health coaching; Therapeutic interventions; Moral development learning; Clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; Healthcare quality assessment; Therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; Providing health information and advice. (3) Gaps in knowledge (4 themes) Educational effectiveness of AI-assisted learning; Patient diversity and AI technologies; Implementation of AI technologies in education and practice settings; Safety and clinical effectiveness of AI technologies. (4) Key areas for development (3 themes) Enriching education, learning and clinical practice; Extending healing spaces; Enhancing healing relationships.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There is an association between AI technologies and compassion in healthcare and interest in this association has grown internationally over the last decade. In a range of healthcare contexts, AI technologies are being used to enhance empathetic awareness; empathetic response and relational behavior; communication skills; health coaching; therapeutic interventions; moral development learning; clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; healthcare quality assessment; therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; and to provide health information and advice. The findings inform a reconceptualization of compassion as a human-AI system of intelligent caring comprising six elements: (1) Awareness of suffering (e.g., pain, distress, risk, disadvantage); (2) Understanding the suffering (significance, context, rights, responsibilities etc.); (3) Connecting with the suffering (e.g., verbal, physical, signs and symbols); (4) Making a judgment about the suffering (the need to act); (5) Responding with an intention to alleviate the suffering; (6) Attention to the effect and outcomes of the response. These elements can operate at an individual (human or machine) and collective systems level (healthcare organizations or systems) as a cyclical system to alleviate different types of suffering. New and novel approaches to human-AI intelligent caring could enrich education, learning, and clinical practice; extend healing spaces; and enhance healing relationships.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      In a complex adaptive system such as healthcare, human-AI intelligent caring will need to be implemented, not as an ideology, but through strategic choices, incentives, regulation, professional education, and training, as well as through joined up thinking about human-AI intelligent caring. Research funders can encourage research and development into the topic of AI technologies and compassion as a system of human-AI intelligent caring. Educators, technologists, and health professionals can inform themselves about the system of human-AI intelligent caring.",0
"In Pavlovian conditioning, the strength of a conditioned response is a function of the probability of reinforcement. However, manipulations of probability are often confounded with changes in the rate of reinforcement. Two between-group experiments in mice evaluated the effect of the probability of reinforcement, while controlling the rate of reinforcement, on appetitive conditioning and extinction. Experiment 1 equated the reinforcement rate by manipulating the number of reinforcements received in each reinforced trial in a critical group (one vs. two consecutive rewards). The results of this experiment showed that probability influenced the rate of responses in acquisition, even when controlling the reinforcement rate. Experiment 2 further assessed the role of probability on behavior while controlling the rate of reinforcement during the conditioned stimulus (CS) using a split-trial design, in which the total CS time was held constant but presented in different numbers of discrete trials (e.g., 50% reinforcement with two 12 s CS's vs. 100% reinforcement with a 24 s average CS duration). This experiment confirmed that probability influenced response rates, and both the probability and rate of reinforcement affected the proportion of trials with responses. Together, these results suggest that the probability of reinforcement, while having little effect on the speed at which responses emerged, affects responding even when the rate of reinforcement is held constant. The results challenge formal learning theories to account for the effects of both the probability and rate of reinforcement. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).",0
"In complex tasks, high performers often have better strategies than low performers, even with similar amounts of practice. Relatively little research has examined how people form and change strategies in tasks that permit a large set of strategies. One challenge with such research is identifying strategies based on behavior. Three algorithms were developed that track the task features people use in their strategies while performing a complex task. Two of these algorithms were based on task-general, machine-learning classifiers: a support vector machine and a decision tree algorithm. The third was a task-specific algorithm. Data from several strategies in a complex task were simulated, and the algorithms were tested to see how well they identified the underlying features of the simulated strategy. The two machine-learning classifiers performed better than the task-specific algorithm. However, the two classifiers differed on how well they identified different types of strategies. The first two studies show that the ability of these algorithms to recover the underlying strategy depends on the complexity of the strategy relative to the quantity of performance data available. If the underlying strategy changes too frequently, then the performance of the algorithms suffers. However, results from the third study show that it is possible to use these algorithms to track strategy changes that occur in a task. The fourth study examines performance on data from human participants. This approach to tracking strategy exploration may enable further development of theories about how people search for and select effective strategies.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad transdisciplinary field with roots in logic, statistics, cognitive psychology, decision theory, neuroscience, linguistics, cybernetics, and computer engineering. The modern field of AI began at a small summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. Since then, AI applications made possible by machine learning (ML), an AI subdiscipline, include Internet searches, e-commerce sites, goods and services recommender systems, image and speech recognition, sensor technologies, robotic devices, and cognitive decision support systems (DSSs). As more applications are integrated into everyday life, AI is predicted to have a globally transformative influence on economic and social structures similar to the effect that other general-purpose technologies, such as steam engines, railroads, electricity, electronics, and the Internet, have had. Novel AI applications in the workplace of the future raise important issues for occupational safety and health. This commentary reviews the origins of AI, use of ML methods, and emerging AI applications embedded in physical objects like sensor technologies, robotic devices, or operationalized in intelligent DSSs. Selected implications on the future of work arising from the use of AI applications, including job displacement from automation and management of human-machine interactions, are also reviewed. Engaging in strategic foresight about AI workplace applications will shift occupational research and practice from a reactive posture to a proactive one. Understanding the possibilities and challenges of AI for the future of work will help mitigate the unfavorable effects of AI on worker safety, health, and well-being.",0
"Retrieving a consolidated memory--by exposing an animal to the learned stimulus but not to the associated reinforcement--leads to two opposing processes: one that weakens the old memory as a result of extinction learning, and another that strengthens the old, already-consolidated memory as a result of some less well-understood form of learning. This latter process of memory strengthening is often referred to as ""reconsolidation"", since protein synthesis can inhibit this form of memory formation. Although the behavioral phenomena of the two antagonizing forms of learning are well documented, the mechanisms behind the corresponding processes of memory formation are still quite controversial. Referring to results of extinction/reconsolidation experiments in honeybees, we argue that two opposing learning processes--with their respective consolidation phases and memories--are initiated by retrieval trials: extinction learning and reminder learning, the latter leading to the phenomenon of spontaneous recovery from extinction, a process that can be blocked with protein synthesis inhibition.",0
"This paper addresses the bipartite synchronization problem of coupled inertia memristor-based neural networks with both cooperative and competitive interactions. Generally, coopetition interaction networks are modeled by a signed graph, and the corresponding Laplacian matrix is different from the nonnegative graph. The coopetition networks with structural balance can reach a final state with identical magnitude but opposite sign, which is called bipartite synchronization. Additionally, an inertia system is a second-order differential system. In this paper, firstly, by using suitable variable substitutions, the inertia memristor-based neural networks (IMNNs) are transformed into the first-order differential equations. Secondly, by designing suitable discontinuous controllers, the bipartite synchronization criteria for IMNNs with or without a leader node on coopetition networks are obtained. Finally, two illustrative examples with simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed discontinuous control strategies for achieving bipartite synchronization.",0
"The use of fundus images for the early screening of eye diseases is of great clinical importance. Due to its powerful performance, deep learning is becoming more and more popular in related applications, such as lesion segmentation, biomarkers segmentation, disease diagnosis and image synthesis. Therefore, it is very necessary to summarize the recent developments in deep learning for fundus images with a review paper. In this review, we introduce 143 application papers with a carefully designed hierarchy. Moreover, 33 publicly available datasets are presented. Summaries and analyses are provided for each task. Finally, limitations common to all tasks are revealed and possible solutions are given. We will also release and regularly update the state-of-the-art results and newly-released datasets at https://github.com/nkicsl/Fundus_Review to adapt to the rapid development of this field.",0
"Since the first revelation of proteins functioning as macromolecular machines through their three dimensional structures, researchers have been intrigued by the marvelous ways the biochemical processes are carried out by proteins. The aspiration to understand protein structures has fueled extensive efforts across different scientific disciplines. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that proteins with new functionality or shapes can be designed via structure-based modeling methods, and the design strategies have combined all available information - but largely piece-by-piece - from sequence derived statistics to the detailed atomic-level modeling of chemical interactions. Despite the significant progress, incorporating data-derived approaches through the use of deep learning methods can be a game changer. In this review, we summarize current progress, compare the arc of developing the deep learning approaches with the conventional methods, and describe the motivation and concepts behind current strategies that may lead to potential future opportunities.",0
"Procedural arrangements of differential reinforcement of alternative behavior without extinction often involve presenting the same reinforcers for problem behavior and appropriate behavior, which is typically ineffective at reducing problem behavior and increasing an alternative response. However, manipulating reinforcement dimensions such that the contingencies favor the alternative response may improve treatment outcomes when using differential reinforcement of alternative behavior without extinction by increasing appropriate behavior and reducing problem behavior. We conducted this translational study with 32 college students completing a button-pressing task on a computer program in which they could engage in analogs to problem behavior and appropriate behavior. The effects of manipulating magnitude, immediacy, quality, and a combination of all three dimensions for the alternative response were evaluated. Overall, all dimension manipulations reduced the analog to problem behavior, with the largest reductions observed during the quality probe and the probe with all dimensions combined. These results support the notion that differential reinforcement of alternative behavior without extinction can be an effective form of treatment.",0
"Significance:
        
      
      The imaging of objects hidden in light-scattering media is a vital practical task in a wide range of applications, including biological imaging. Deep-learning-based methods have been used to reconstruct images behind scattering media under complex scattering conditions, but improvements in the quality of the reconstructed images are required.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To investigate the effect of image plane on the accuracy of reconstructed images.
    


          Approach:
        
      
      Light reflected from an object passing through glass diffusers is captured by changing the image plane of an optical imaging system. Images are reconstructed by deep learning, and evaluated in terms of structural similarity index measure, classification accuracy of digital images, and training and testing error curves.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The reconstruction accuracy was improved for the case in which the diffuser was imaged, compared to the case where the object was imaged. The training and testing error curves show that the loss converged to lower values in fewer epochs when the diffuser was imaged.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The proposed approach demonstrates an improvement in the accuracy of the reconstruction of objects hidden through glass diffusers by imaging glass diffuser surfaces, and can be applied to objects at unknown locations in a scattering medium.",0
"Deep generative models can learn the underlying structure, such as pathways or gene programs, from omics data. We provide an introduction as well as an overview of such techniques, specifically illustrating their use with single-cell gene expression data. For example, the low dimensional latent representations offered by various approaches, such as variational auto-encoders, are useful to get a better understanding of the relations between observed gene expressions and experimental factors or phenotypes. Furthermore, by providing a generative model for the latent and observed variables, deep generative models can generate synthetic observations, which allow us to assess the uncertainty in the learned representations. While deep generative models are useful to learn the structure of high-dimensional omics data by efficiently capturing non-linear dependencies between genes, they are sometimes difficult to interpret due to their neural network building blocks. More precisely, to understand the relationship between learned latent variables and observed variables, e.g., gene transcript abundances and external phenotypes, is difficult. Therefore, we also illustrate current approaches that allow us to infer the relationship between learned latent variables and observed variables as well as external phenotypes. Thereby, we render deep learning approaches more interpretable. In an application with single-cell gene expression data, we demonstrate the utility of the discussed methods.",0
"When reinforcer availability on one alternative of a concurrent schedule is signaled by a discriminative stimulus, responding on that alternative decreases. We investigated how the correlation between signal presentation and reinforcement (signal reliability) affects choice between signaled and unsignaled alternatives. Six pigeons responded in a concurrent schedule, in which reinforcers on one alternative were signaled by a key-color change. Across conditions, the probability of reinforcement following signal presentation varied (the probability in its absence was the complement). As signal reliability increased, response rates and latencies following signal onset on the signaled alternative decreased, whereas responding on the unsignaled alternative remained unchanged. Because the signal did not alter overall reinforcer rates, these findings are consistent with matching theories and research suggesting that responding on one alternative of a concurrent schedule depends on reinforcer, but not response, rates on other alternatives. However, these findings are inconsistent with others demonstrating concomitant changes in responding on signaled and unsignaled alternatives. We consider whether a response-competition account of concurrent performance can explain these discrepancies, and suggest avenues for future studies to investigate the mechanisms underlying effects of signaled reinforcement in concurrent schedules.",0
"Objectives:
        
      
      Developing accurate supervised machine learning algorithms is hampered by the lack of representative annotated datasets. Most data in anatomic pathology are unlabeled and creating large, annotated datasets is a time consuming and laborious process. Unsupervised learning, which does not require annotated data, possesses the potential to assist with this challenge. This review aims to introduce the concept of unsupervised learning and illustrate how clustering, generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders have the potential to address the lack of annotated data in anatomic pathology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A review of unsupervised learning with examples from the literature was carried out.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Clustering can be used as part of semisupervised learning where labels are propagated from a subset of annotated data points to remaining unlabeled data points in a dataset. GANs may assist by generating large amounts of synthetic data and performing color normalization. Autoencoders allow training of a network on a large, unlabeled dataset and transferring learned representations to a classifier using a smaller, labeled subset (unsupervised pretraining).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Unsupervised machine learning techniques such as clustering, GANs, and autoencoders, used individually or in combination, may help address the lack of annotated data in pathology and improve the process of developing supervised learning models.",0
"As it seems likely that France, at the forefront in the use of surgical robotic platforms, will authorize the deployment of dental robots in the short term, the purpose of this article is to question what is at stake in this technological revolution, for dental professionals, regulators but also (and above all) for patients: what awareness-raising will the intervention of machines bring? How does robotics reshuffle the cards of the care relationship? What are the ethical and public health issues? After having defined dental robots as non-humanoid, automated surgical devices with exclusive restorative vocation, we will see how the field of dental robotics currently oscillates between hopes and illusions. We will describe the new responsibilities and ethical requirements related to the introduction of these AI-powered technical objects, as well as the necessary safeguards that have to be implemented in order to avoid any moral buffer and to protect patients from any robotization (literally or metaphorically in the sense of ‘zombification’). Finally, we will show that ultimately the question of robot-dentists is the natural evolution of unreasonable application of industrial processes to the rationalization of health and ectopic, neo-liberal practices shifting healthcare into a commercial commodity. Patients can participate in reversing this trend, by recalling that the centrality of the human person is the cornerstone of health professions.",0
"Graph-based neural networks have promising perspectives but are limited by electronic bottlenecks. Our work explores the advantages of optical neural networks in the graph domain. We propose an optical graph neural network (OGNN) based on inverse-designed optical processing units (OPUs) to classify graphs with optics. The OPUs, combined with two types of optical components, can perform multiply-accumulate, matrix-vector multiplication, and matrix-matrix multiplication operations. The proposed OGNN can classify typical non-Euclidean MiniGCDataset graphs and successfully predict 1000 test graphs with 100% accuracy. The OPU-formed optical-electrical graph attention network is also scalable to handle more complex graph data, such as the Cora dataset, with 89.0% accuracy.",0
"Biotic and abiotic stresses significantly affect plant fitness, resulting in a serious loss in food production. Biotic and abiotic stresses predominantly affect metabolite biosynthesis, gene and protein expression, and genome variations. However, light doses of stress result in the production of positive attributes in crops, like tolerance to stress and biosynthesis of metabolites, called hormesis. Advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled the development of high-throughput gadgets such as high-resolution imagery sensors and robotic aerial vehicles, i.e., satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), to overcome biotic and abiotic stresses. These High throughput (HTP) gadgets produce accurate but big amounts of data. Significant datasets such as transportable array for remotely sensed agriculture and phenotyping reference platform (TERRA-REF) have been developed to forecast abiotic stresses and early detection of biotic stresses. For accurately measuring the model plant stress, tools like Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) have enabled early detection of desirable traits in a large population of breeding material and mitigate plant stresses. In this review, advanced applications of ML and DL in plant biotic and abiotic stress management have been summarized.",0

"Objective:
        
      
      Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience, neural engineering (e.g. Brain-computer interfaces, BCI's), and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks?
    


          Approach:
        
      
      A systematic literature review of EEG classification using deep learning was performed on Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 90 identified studies. Those studies were analyzed based on type of task, EEG preprocessing methods, input type, and deep learning architecture.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      For EEG classification tasks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks outperform stacked auto-encoders and multi-layer perceptron neural networks in classification accuracy. The tasks that used deep learning fell into five general groups: emotion recognition, motor imagery, mental workload, seizure detection, event related potential detection, and sleep scoring. For each type of task, we describe the specific input formulation, major characteristics, and end classifier recommendations found through this review.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      This review summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes in the use of deep learning for EEG classification. Practical suggestions on the selection of many hyperparameters are provided in the hope that they will promote or guide the deployment of deep learning to EEG datasets in future research.",0

      Brain disorders are one of the major global mortality issues, and their early detection is crucial for healing. Machine learning, specifically deep learning, is a technology that is increasingly being used to detect and diagnose brain disorders. Our objective is to provide a quantitative bibliometric analysis of the field to inform researchers about trends that can inform their Research directions in the future.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We carried out a bibliometric analysis to create an overview of brain disorder detection and diagnosis using machine learning and deep learning. Our bibliometric analysis includes 1550 articles gathered from the Scopus database on automated brain disorder detection and diagnosis using machine learning and deep learning published from 2015 to May 2023. A thorough bibliometric análisis is carried out with the help of Biblioshiny and the VOSviewer platform. Citation analysis and various measures of collaboration are analyzed in the study.

      According to a study, maximum research is reported in 2022, with a consistent rise from preceding years. The majority of the authors referenced have concentrated on multiclass classification and innovative convolutional neural network models that are effective in this field. A keyword analysis revealed that among the several brain disorder types, Alzheimer's, autism, and Parkinson's disease had received the greatest attention. In terms of both authors and institutes, the USA, China, and India are among the most collaborating countries.

"Living beings have an unsurpassed range of ways to manipulate objects and interact with them. They can make autonomous decisions and can heal themselves. So far, a conventional robot cannot mimic this complexity even remotely. Classical robots are often used to help with lifting and gripping and thus to alleviate the effects of menial tasks. Sensors can render robots responsive, and artificial intelligence aims at enabling autonomous responses. Inanimate soft robots are a step in this direction, but it will only be in combination with living systems that full complexity will be achievable. The field of biohybrid soft robotics provides entirely new concepts to address current challenges, for example the ability to self-heal, enable a soft touch, or to show situational versatility. Therefore, ""living materials"" are at the heart of this review. Similarly to biological taxonomy, there is a recent effort for taxonomy of biohybrid soft robotics. Here, an expansion is proposed to take into account not only function and origin of biohybrid soft robotic components, but also the materials. This materials taxonomy key demonstrates visually that materials science will drive the development of the field of soft biohybrid robotics.",0
"As a new concept that emerged in the middle of 1990's, data mining can help researchers gain both novel and deep insights and can facilitate unprecedented understanding of large biomedical datasets. Data mining can uncover new biomedical and healthcare knowledge for clinical and administrative decision making as well as generate scientific hypotheses from large experimental data, clinical databases, and/or biomedical literature. This review first introduces data mining in general (e.g., the background, definition, and process of data mining), discusses the major differences between statistics and data mining and then speaks to the uniqueness of data mining in the biomedical and healthcare fields. A brief summarization of various data mining algorithms used for classification, clustering, and association as well as their respective advantages and drawbacks is also presented. Suggested guidelines on how to use data mining algorithms in each area of classification, clustering, and association are offered along with three examples of how data mining has been used in the healthcare industry. Given the successful application of data mining by health related organizations that has helped to predict health insurance fraud and under-diagnosed patients, and identify and classify at-risk people in terms of health with the goal of reducing healthcare cost, we introduce how data mining technologies (in each area of classification, clustering, and association) have been used for a multitude of purposes, including research in the biomedical and healthcare fields. A discussion of the technologies available to enable the prediction of healthcare costs (including length of hospital stay), disease diagnosis and prognosis, and the discovery of hidden biomedical and healthcare patterns from related databases is offered along with a discussion of the use of data mining to discover such relationships as those between health conditions and a disease, relationships among diseases, and relationships among drugs. The article concludes with a discussion of the problems that hamper the clinical use of data mining by health professionals.",0
"The rapid evolution of neural networks and deep learning has revolutionized various fields, with clinical cardiology being no exception. As traditional methods in cardiology encounter limitations, the integration of advanced computational techniques offers unprecedented opportunities in diagnostics and patient care. This review explores the transformative role of neural networks and deep learning in clinical cardiology, particularly focusing on their applications in electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, imaging technologies, and cardiac prediction models. Among others, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly surpassed traditional approaches in accuracy and efficiency in automatic ECG diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are successfully applied in PET/CT and PET/MR imaging, enhancing diagnostic capabilities. Furthermore, deep learning algorithms have shown potential in improving cardiac prediction models, although challenges in interpretability and clinical integration remain. The review also addresses the 'black box' nature of neural networks and the ethical considerations surrounding their use in clinical settings. Overall, this review underscores the significant impact of neural networks and deep learning in cardiology, providing insights into current applications and future directions in the field.",0
"De novo drug design aims to generate novel chemical compounds with desirable chemical and pharmacological properties from scratch using computer-based methods. Recently, deep generative neural networks have become a very active research frontier in de novo drug discovery, both in theoretical and in experimental evidence, shedding light on a promising new direction of automatic molecular generation and optimization. In this review, we discussed recent development of deep learning models for molecular generation and summarized them as four different generative architectures with four different optimization strategies. We also discussed future directions of deep generative models for de novo drug design.",0
"Fifty-three empirical laboratory studies of self-reinforcement (SR) published between 1962 and 1977 are discussed and critiqued. Studies are organized under two major headings--infrahuman and human--and are summarized in relation to the acquisition, motivational properties and comparative effectiveness of SR procedures. Each experiment is rated in terms of the degree to which the procedures reported represent actual SR operations, and in terms of overall experimental validity. The reviewed literature shows that SR behavioral patterns can be readily acquired through modeling or direct external reinforcement; and affected by a variety of training, individual difference, procedural, and task factors; and, once acquired, have sometimes been shown to possess functional reinforcing properties, and to be generally as effective as external reinforcement procedures in maintaining and strengthening conditional or target responses. A variety of methodological and theoretical issues pertaining to SR research are discussed, and the relationships between SR and contemporary radical operant and social learning psychology are discussed.",0
"In contrast to other surgical fields, robotics is relatively new to spinal surgery. The initial focus for spinal robotics has been on accurate pedicle screw placement, which early studies have shown to be successful. Beyond pedicle screw placement, however, newer generation spinal robots have the capability of navigation, which can impact other aspects of a spinal procedure. In this study, pedicle screw placement with the recently introduced Excelsius GPS robot (Globus) was similarly found to be accurate in a cohort of patients undergoing both open and minimally invasive fusion. Potential applications of the spinal robot's navigation capability are demonstrated.",0
"The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data represent a source of information in real time not only about electricity consumption but also as an indicator of other social, demographic, and economic dynamics within a city. This paper presents a Data Analytics/Big Data framework applied to AMI data as a tool to leverage the potential of this data within the applications in a Smart City. The framework includes three fundamental aspects. First, the architectural view places AMI within the Smart Grids Architecture Model-SGAM. Second, the methodological view describes the transformation of raw data into knowledge represented by the DIKW hierarchy and the NIST Big Data interoperability model. Finally, a binding element between the two views is represented by human expertise and skills to obtain a deeper understanding of the results and transform knowledge into wisdom. Our new view faces the challenges arriving in energy markets by adding a binding element that gives support for optimal and efficient decision-making. To show how our framework works, we developed a case study. The case implements each component of the framework for a load forecasting application in a Colombian Retail Electricity Provider (REP). The MAPE for some of the REP's markets was less than 5%. In addition, the case shows the effect of the binding element as it raises new development alternatives and becomes a feedback mechanism for more assertive decision making.",0
"Significant advances have been achieved in protein structure prediction, especially with the recent development of the AlphaFold2 and the RoseTTAFold systems. This article reviews the progress in deep learning-based protein structure prediction methods in the past two years. First, we divide the representative methods into two categories: the two-step approach and the end-to-end approach. Then, we show that the two-step approach is possible to achieve similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art end-to-end approach AlphaFold2. Compared to the end-to-end approach, the two-step approach requires fewer computing resources. We conclude that it is valuable to keep developing both approaches. Finally, a few outstanding challenges in function-orientated protein structure prediction are pointed out for future development.",0
"Preventive identification of mechanical parts failures has always played a crucial role in machine maintenance. Over time, as the processing cycles are repeated, the machinery in the production system is subject to wear with a consequent loss of technical efficiency compared to optimal conditions. These conditions can, in some cases, lead to the breakage of the elements with consequent stoppage of the production process pending the replacement of the element. This situation entails a large loss of turnover on the part of the company. For this reason, it is crucial to be able to predict failures in advance to try to replace the element before its wear can cause a reduction in machine performance. Several systems have recently been developed for the preventive faults detection that use a combination of low-cost sensors and algorithms based on machine learning. In this work the different methodologies for the identification of the most common mechanical failures are examined and the most widely applied algorithms based on machine learning are analyzed: Support Vector Machine (SVM) solutions, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) applications, and Deep Generative Systems. These topics have been described in detail and the works most appreciated by the scientific community have been reviewed to highlight the strengths in identifying faults and to outline the directions for future challenges.",0
"The agent learns to organize decision behavior to achieve a behavioral goal, such as reward maximization, and reinforcement learning is often used for this optimization. Learning an optimal behavioral strategy is difficult under the uncertainty that events necessary for learning are only partially observable, called as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). However, the real-world environment also gives many events irrelevant to reward delivery and an optimal behavioral strategy. The conventional methods in POMDP, which attempt to infer transition rules among the entire observations, including irrelevant states, are ineffective in such an environment. Supposing Redundantly Observable Markov Decision Process (ROMDP), here we propose a method for goal-oriented reinforcement learning to efficiently learn state transition rules among reward-related ""core states"" from redundant observations. Starting with a small number of initial core states, our model gradually adds new core states to the transition diagram until it achieves an optimal behavioral strategy consistent with the Bellman equation. We demonstrate that the resultant inference model outperforms the conventional method for POMDP. We emphasize that our model only containing the core states has high explainability. Furthermore, the proposed method suits online learning as it suppresses memory consumption and improves learning speed.",0
"Since the concept of deep learning (DL) was formally proposed in 2006, it has had a major impact on academic research and industry. Nowadays, DL provides an unprecedented way to analyze and process data with demonstrated great results in computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, and so forth. Herein, applications of DL in NMR spectroscopy are summarized, and a perspective for DL as an entirely new approach that is likely to transform NMR spectroscopy into a much more efficient and powerful technique in chemistry and life sciences is outlined.",0
"Recent advances in data science are impacting the development of classical force fields. Here we review some ideas and techniques from data science that have been used in force field development, including database construction, atom typing, and machine learning potentials. We highlight how new tools such as active learning and automatic differentiation are facilitating the generation of target data and the direct fitting with macroscopic observables. Philosophical changes on how force field models should be built and used are also discussed. It's inspiring that more accurate biomolecular force fields can be developed with the aid of data science techniques.",0
"Background:
        
      
      The emergence of big data and data science offers unprecedented opportunities for accelerating scientific advances in nursing, yet current nursing curricula are not adequate to prepare students to leverage those opportunities.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this review was to describe current strategies that can be used to educate graduate nurses about data science methods as well as facilitators and challenges to adopting those strategies.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We conducted a critical literature review of papers addressing data science and graduate nursing education.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ten articles were included in this review. The most common strategy was the integration of data science methods into existing courses throughout the graduate nursing curricula. A major facilitator was interdisciplinary collaboration between nursing faculty and colleagues in other disciplines.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The findings provide strategies that can be used to prepare graduate nurses to work in data science teams to shape big data research and optimize patient outcomes.",0
"China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is currently wrestling with the benefits and challenges of using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance their capabilities. Like many other militaries, a key factor in their analysis is identifying and dealing with the ethical implications of employing AI-enabled systems. Unlike other militaries, however, as the PLA is directly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP-""the Party""), such considerations are conspicuously influenced by a definition of military ethics that is fundamentally political. This Mini-Review briefly discusses key tenets of PLA military ethics and then investigates how the challenges of military AI ethics are being addressed in publicly-available government and PLA publications. Analysis indicates that, while the PLA is considering AI ethical challenges that are common to all militaries (e.g., accountability), their overriding challenge that they face is ""squaring the circle"" of benefitting from autonomous AI capabilities while providing the CCP with the absolute control of the PLA that it demands-which is, from the CCP's perspective, a military ethics consideration. All Chinese translations are my own.",0
"In photoacoustic tomography (PAT), conventional image reconstruction methods are generally based on the assumption of an ideal point-like ultrasonic detector. This assumption is appropriate when the receiving surface of the detector is sufficiently small and/or the distance between the imaged object and the detector is large enough. However, it does not hold in endoscopic applications of PAT. In this study, we propose a model-based image reconstruction method for endoscopic photoacoustic tomography (EPAT), considering the effect of detector responses on image quality. We construct a forward model to physically describe the imaging process of EPAT, including the generation of the initial pressure due to optical absorption and thermoelastic expansion, the propagation of photoacoustic waves in tissues, and the acoustic measurement. The model outputs the theoretical sampling voltage signal, which is the response of the ultrasonic detector to the acoustic pressure reaching its receiving surface. The images representing the distribution map of the optical absorption energy density on cross-sections of the imaged luminal structures are reconstructed from the sampling voltage signals output by the detector through iterative inversion of the forward model. Compared with the conventional approaches based on back-projection and other imaging models, our method improved the quality and spatial resolution of the resulting images.",0
"Current best practice in the quantitative analysis of microscopy images dictates that image files should be saved in a lossless format such as TIFF. Use of lossy files, including those processed with the JPEG algorithm, is highly discouraged due to effects of compression on pixel characteristics. However, with the growing popularity of whole-slide imaging (WSI) and its attendant large file sizes, compressed image files are becoming more prevelent. This prompted us to perform a color-based quantitative pixel analysis of minimally compressed WSI images. Sections from three tissues stained with one of three reagents representing the colors blue (hematoxylin), red (Oil-Red-O), and brown (immunoperoxidase) were scanned with a whole slide imager in triplicate at 20x, 40x, and 63x magnifications. The resulting files were in the form of a BigTIFF with a JPEG compression automatically applied during acquisition. Images were imported into analysis software, six regions of interest were applied to various morphological locations, and the areas assessed for the color of interest. Whereas the number of designated weakly or strongly positive pixels was variable across the triplicate scans for the individual regions of interest, the total number of positive pixels was consistent. These results suggest that total positivity for a specific color representing a histochemical or immunohistochemical stain can be adequately quantitated on compressed images, but degrees of positivity (e.g., weak vs. strong) may not be as reliable. However, it is important to assess individual whole-slide imagers, file compression level and algorithm, and analysis software for reproducibility.",0
"Nurses have traditionally been regarded as clinicians that deliver compassionate, safe, and empathetic health care (Nurses again outpace other professions for honesty & ethics, 2018). Caring is a fundamental characteristic, expectation, and moral obligation of the nursing and caregiving professions (Nursing: Scope and standards of practice, American Nurses Association, Silver Spring, MD, 2015). Along with caring, nurses are expected to undertake ever-expanding duties and complex tasks. In part because of the growing physical, intellectual and emotional demandingness, of nursing as well as technological advances, artificial intelligence (AI) and AI care robots are rapidly changing the healthcare landscape. As technology becomes more advanced, efficient, and economical, opportunities and pressure to introduce AI into nursing care will only increase. In the first part of the article, we review recent and existing applications of AI in nursing and speculate on future use. Second, situate our project within the recent literature on the ethics of nursing and AI. Third, we explore three dominant theories of caring and the two paradigmatic expressions of caring (touch and presence) and conclude that AI-at least for the foreseeable future-is incapable of caring in the sense central to nursing and caregiving ethics. We conclude that for AI to be implemented ethically, it cannot transgress the core values of nursing, usurp aspects of caring that can only meaningfully be carried out by human beings, and it must support, open, or improve opportunities for nurses to provide the uniquely human aspects of care.",0
"Objectives:
        
      
      Different stakeholders may hold varying attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare, which may constrain their acceptance if AI developers fail to take them into account. We set out to ascertain evidence of the attitudes of clinicians, consumers, managers, researchers, regulators and industry towards AI applications in healthcare.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We undertook an exploratory analysis of articles whose titles or abstracts contained the terms 'artificial intelligence' or 'AI' and 'medical' or 'healthcare' and 'attitudes', 'perceptions', 'opinions', 'views', 'expectations'. Using a snowballing strategy, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar for articles published 1 January 2010 through 31 May 2021. We selected articles relating to non-robotic clinician-facing AI applications used to support healthcare-related tasks or decision-making.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Across 27 studies, attitudes towards AI applications in healthcare, in general, were positive, more so for those with direct experience of AI, but provided certain safeguards were met. AI applications which automated data interpretation and synthesis were regarded more favourably by clinicians and consumers than those that directly influenced clinical decisions or potentially impacted clinician-patient relationships. Privacy breaches and personal liability for AI-related error worried clinicians, while loss of clinician oversight and inability to fully share in decision-making worried consumers. Both clinicians and consumers wanted AI-generated advice to be trustworthy, while industry groups emphasised AI benefits and wanted more data, funding and regulatory certainty.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Certain expectations of AI applications were common to many stakeholder groups from which a set of dependencies can be defined.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Stakeholders differ in some but not all of their attitudes towards AI. Those developing and implementing applications should consider policies and processes that bridge attitudinal disconnects between different stakeholders.",0
"Computational methods have gained prominence in healthcare research. The accessibility of healthcare data has greatly incited academicians and researchers to develop executions that help in prognosis of cancer drug response. Among various computational methods, machine-learning (ML) and deep-learning (DL) methods provide the most consistent and effectual approaches to handle the serious aftermaths of the deadly disease and drug administered to the patients. Hence, this systematic literature review has reviewed researches that have investigated drug discovery and prognosis of anticancer drug response using ML and DL algorithms. Fot this purpose, PRISMA guidelines have been followed to choose research papers from Google Scholar, PubMed, and Sciencedirect websites. A total count of 105 papers that align with the context of this review were chosen. Further, the review also presents accuracy of the existing ML and DL methods in the prediction of anticancer drug response. It has been found from the review that, amidst the availability of various studies, there are certain challenges associated with each method. Thus, future researchers can consider these limitations and challenges to develop a prominent anticancer drug response prediction method, and it would be greatly beneficial to the medical professionals in administering non-invasive treatment to the patients.",0
"Since its beginnings in the 1960s, soft robotics has been a steadily growing field that has enjoyed recent growth with the advent of rapid prototyping and the provision of new flexible materials. These two innovations have enabled the development of fully flexible and untethered soft robotic systems. The integration of novel sensors enabled by new manufacturing processes and materials shows promise for enabling the production of soft systems with 'embodied intelligence'. Here, four experts present their perspectives for the future of the field of soft robotics based on these past innovations. Their focus is on finding answers to the questions of: how to manufacture soft robots, and on how soft robots can sense, move, and think. We highlight industrial production techniques, which are unused to date for manufacturing soft robots. They discuss how novel tactile sensors for soft robots could be created to enable better interaction of the soft robot with the environment. In conclusion this article highlights how embodied intelligence in soft robots could be used to make soft robots think and to make systems that can compute, autonomously, from sensory inputs.",0
"The traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) enterprises have accumulated a large amount of product quality review(PQR) data. Mining these data can reveal the hidden knowledge in production and helps improve pharmaceutical manufacturing technology. However, there are few studies involving the mining of PQR data and thus enterprises lack the guidance to analyze the data. This study proposed a method to mine the PQR data, which consisted of 4 functional modules: data collection and preprocessing, risk classification of variables, risk evaluation by batches, and the regression analysis of quality. Further, we carried out a case study of the formulation process of a TCM product to illustrate the method. In the case study, the data of 398 batches of products during 2019-2021 were collected, which contained 65 process variables. The risks of variables were classified according to the process performance index. The risk of each batch was analyzed through short-term and long-term evaluation, and the critical variables with the strongest impact on the product quality were identified by partial least square regression. The results showed that 1 variable and 13 batches were of high risk, and the critical process variable was the quality of the intermediates. The proposed method enables enterprises to comprehensively mine the PQR data and helps to enhance the process understanding and improve the quality control.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Reddit is a popular social media discussion forum. Reddit data can be analyzed with natural language processing techniques to gain insights into public health questions by tracking frequency of discussion on relevant topics over time and analysis of discussion content.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To apply natural language processing techniques to categorize, track, and gain insights from comments regarding skincare-related topics on Reddit using sentiment analysis and word search techniques.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Historical Reddit comments available on Google BigQuery from the r/SkincareAddiction subreddit were selected and preprocessed. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was applied to create topics. Selected topics were further investigated for interest over time, by determining comment frequencies of words of interest. Sentiment analysis was also applied to each topic.
    


          Results:
        
      
      >3,000,000 comments were analyzed and classified into 25 topics. Topics related to sunscreen, diet, and exfoliants were examined for response frequencies over time, demonstrating seasonal variation. Taking comment frequencies demonstrated peaks containing ""coral"" and ""oxybenzone"" that corresponded to media coverage of sunscreen-associated coral bleaching. Queries containing ""physical"" and ""mineral"" demonstrated an evolution in word choice describing physical/mineral sunscreens over time. Sentiment analysis demonstrated a range from mildly positive to moderately positive sentiment across the five examined skincare topics.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Our analysis was limited to one subreddit category. Additionally, Latent Dirichlet Allocation is an unsupervised model; its accuracy cannot be readily assessed. Taking comment frequencies for words, while powerful, cannot be used to find word trends that are not intentionally queried by the user.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Natural language processing is a powerful tool to examine large dermatology discussion forums and gain insights into patient perceptions of the field.",0
"Machine learning (ML) is a burgeoning field of medicine with huge resources being applied to fuse computer science and statistics to medical problems. Proponents of ML extol its ability to deal with large, complex and disparate data, often found within medicine and feel that ML is the future for biomedical research, personalized medicine, computer-aided diagnosis to significantly advance global health care. However, the concepts of ML are unfamiliar to many medical professionals and there is untapped potential in the use of ML as a research tool. In this article, we provide an overview of the theory behind ML, explore the common ML algorithms used in medicine including their pitfalls and discuss the potential future of ML in medicine.",0
"Data science health research promises tremendous benefits for African populations, but its implementation is fraught with substantial ethical governance risks that could thwart the delivery of these anticipated benefits.

"The conversation about consciousness of artificial intelligence (AI) is an ongoing topic since 1950s. Despite the numerous applications of AI identified in healthcare and primary healthcare, little is known about how a conscious AI would reshape its use in this domain. While there is a wide range of ideas as to whether AI can or cannot possess consciousness, a prevailing theme in all arguments is uncertainty. Given this uncertainty and the high stakes associated with the use of AI in primary healthcare, it is imperative to be prepared for all scenarios including conscious AI systems being used for medical diagnosis, shared decision-making and resource management in the future. This commentary serves as an overview of some of the pertinent evidence supporting the use of AI in primary healthcare and proposes ideas as to how consciousnesses of AI can support or further complicate these applications. Given the scarcity of evidence on the association between consciousness of AI and its current state of use in primary healthcare, our commentary identifies some directions for future research in this area including assessing patients', healthcare workers' and policy-makers' attitudes towards consciousness of AI systems in primary healthcare settings.",0
"Currently, medical institutes generally use EMR to record patient's condition, including diagnostic information, procedures performed, and treatment results. EMR has been recognized as a valuable resource for large-scale analysis. However, EMR has the characteristics of diversity, incompleteness, redundancy, and privacy, which make it difficult to carry out data mining and analysis directly. Therefore, it is necessary to preprocess the source data in order to improve data quality and improve the data mining results. Different types of data require different processing technologies. Most structured data commonly needs classic preprocessing technologies, including data cleansing, data integration, data transformation, and data reduction. For semistructured or unstructured data, such as medical text, containing more health information, it requires more complex and challenging processing methods. The task of information extraction for medical texts mainly includes NER (named-entity recognition) and RE (relation extraction). This paper focuses on the process of EMR processing and emphatically analyzes the key techniques. In addition, we make an in-depth study on the applications developed based on text mining together with the open challenges and research issues for future work.",0
"Delivery of alternative reinforcers in the presence of stimuli previously associated with reinforcement for target behavior increases the susceptibility of target behavior to relapse. To explore contingencies that might mitigate this counter-therapeutic effect, we trained pigeons on a procedure that entailed extinction of previously reinforced target-key pecking, access to a distinct stimulus context contingently on refraining from target behavior (differential-reinforcement-of-other-behavior; DRO), and reinforcement of alternative-key pecks (differential-reinforcement of alternative behavior; DRA) in that context. This DRO-DRA treatment was compared with standard DRA in successive conditions, counterbalanced across pigeons. Target behavior extinguished more rapidly in the Standard-DRA condition. When alternative reinforcement was discontinued, however, there was less resurgence after DRO-DRA than after Standard DRA. In a third condition, the DRO contingency was suspended so that the former DRA stimuli were not presented (DRO-NAC), and resurgence was greater than in the Standard-DRA and DRO-DRA conditions. Reinstatement produced by response-independent reinforcers was small and similar across conditions. Subsequent reacquisition of target-key pecking under baseline reinforcement conditions was faster following DRO-NAC than Standard-DRA or DRO-DRA. These findings suggest that DRO-DRA might serve as a useful method in clinical settings for reducing problem behavior while minimizing the threat of posttreatment relapse.",0
"Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks in medical imaging. However, these approaches primarily focus on supervised learning, assuming that the training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. Unfortunately, this assumption may not always hold true in practice. To address these issues, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques have been developed to transfer knowledge from a labeled domain to a related but unlabeled domain. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in UDA, resulting in a wide range of methodologies, including feature alignment, image translation, self-supervision, and disentangled representation methods, among others. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive literature review of recent deep UDA approaches in medical imaging from a technical perspective. Specifically, we categorize current UDA research in medical imaging into six groups and further divide them into finer subcategories based on the different tasks they perform. We also discuss the respective datasets used in the studies to assess the divergence between the different domains. Finally, we discuss emerging areas and provide insights and discussions on future research directions to conclude this survey.",0
"Acetylcholinesterase enzyme is responsible for the degradation of acetylcholine and is an important drug target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. When this enzyme is inhibited, more acetylcholine is available in the synaptic cleft for the use, which leads to enhanced memory and cognitive ability. The aim of the present work is to create machine learning models for distinguishing between AChE inhibitors and non-inhibitors using algorithms like support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and random forest (RF). The developed models were evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation and external dataset. Descriptor analysis was performed to identify most important features for the activity of molecules. Descriptors which were identified as important include maxssCH2, minHssNH, SaasC, minssCH2, bit 128 MACCS key, bit 104 MACCS key, bit 24 estate fingerprint and bit 18 estate fingerprints. The model developed using fingerprints based on random forest algorithm produced better results compared to other models. The overall accuracy of best model on test set was 85.38 percent. The developed model is available at http://14.139.57.41/achepredictor/ .",0
"Noise is ubiquitous in real space that hinders detection of minute yet important signals in electrical sensors. Here, the authors report on a deep learning approach for denoising ionic current in resistive pulse sensing. Electrophoretically-driven translocation motions of single-nanoparticles in a nano-corrugated nanopore are detected. The noise is reduced by a convolutional auto-encoding neural network, designed to iteratively compare and minimize differences between a pair of waveforms via a gradient descent optimization. This denoising in a high-dimensional feature space is demonstrated to allow detection of the corrugation-derived wavy signals that cannot be identified in the raw curves nor after digital processing in frequency domains under the given noise floor, thereby enabled in-situ tracking to electrokinetic analysis of fast-moving single- and double-nanoparticles. The ability of the unlabeled learning to remove noise without compromising temporal resolution may be useful in solid-state nanopore sensing of protein structure and polynucleotide sequence.",0
"ABA renewal was assessed by decreasing response rates by means of extinction or a 12-s delay of reinforcement in one experiment with rats. In a first phase, rats were trained to lever press for water in Context A. Rats were exposed to a second phase in Context B, where lever-pressing decreased for all rats; for one group of rats, lever-pressing decreased by means of extinction, while lever-pressing decreased by means of a 12-s delay for the other group. During a third phase, both groups were once again exposed to Context A with no reinforcer deliveries for lever-pressing. Once rats were exposed to the latter phase, renewal was observed for both groups. Results suggest that delay of reinforcement can be used as an alternative procedure to help reduce behavior and mitigate relapse.",0
"Emerging evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) can provide new insights and potential therapeutic targets for disease diagnosis and treatment. However, traditional biological experiments are expensive and time-consuming. Recently, deep learning with a more powerful ability for representation learning enables it to be a promising technology for predicting disease-associated circRNAs. In this review, we mainly introduce the most popular databases related to circRNA, and summarize three types of deep learning-based circRNA-disease associations prediction methods: feature-generation-based, type-discrimination and hybrid-based methods. We further evaluate seven representative models on benchmark with ground truth for both balance and imbalance classification tasks. In addition, we discuss the advantages and limitations of each type of method and highlight suggested applications for future research.",0

"Exoskeletons are wearable robots exhibiting a close cognitive and physical interaction with the human user. These are rigid robotic exoskeletal structures that typically operate alongside human limbs. Scientific and technological work on exoskeletons began in the early 1960s but have only recently been applied to rehabilitation and functional substitution in patients suffering from motor disorders. Key topics for further development of exoskeletons in rehabilitation scenarios include the need for robust human-robot multimodal cognitive interaction, safe and dependable physical interaction, true wearability and portability, and user aspects such as acceptance and usability. This discussion provides an overview of these aspects and draws conclusions regarding potential future research directions in robotic exoskeletons.",0
"Nurse scientists are generating, acquiring, distributing, processing, storing, and analyzing greater volumes of complex omics data than ever before. To take full advantage of big omics data, to address core biological questions, and to enhance patient care, however, genomic nurse scientists must embrace data science. Intended for readership with limited but expanding data science knowledge and skills, this article aims to provide a brief overview of the state of data science in genomic nursing. Our goal is to introduce key data science concepts to genomic nurses who participate at any stage of the data science lifecycle, from research patient recruitment to data wrangling, preprocessing, and analysis to implementation in clinical practice to policy creation. We address three major components in this review: (1) fundamental terminology for the field of genomic nursing data science, (2) current genomic nursing data science research exemplars, and (3) the spectrum of genomic nursing data science roles as well as education pathways and training opportunities. Links to helpful resources are included throughout the article.",0
"Many different types of endoscopy robot have been developed or are under development. Some of these innovative biotechnologies are dedicated to complex endoscopic procedures such as endoscopic submucosal dissection whereas others are purely diagnostic. In endoscopy robotics, there are still several problems that need a solution. These problems basically concern robotic locomotion and instrument control, as well as clinical application. In most cases, the technology is still under development. The current fields of investigation are augmented reality, advances in actuation and reduction of hysteresis, optical analysis, wireless movement transmission and many others. Besides endoscopic submucosal dissection, other promising fields of implementation of endoscopy robots are natural orifices transluminal endoscopic surgery and bariatric endoscopy. Obviously, endoscopy robots are expensive, but both doctors and health system providers are becoming more aware of the possibilities that these platforms can offer. Improvement of the performance of endoscopy robots undoubtedly will lead to their widespread use and, therefore, a balance in cost-effectiveness.",0
"AI Ethics is a burgeoning and relatively new field that has emerged in response to growing concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on human individuals and their social institutions. In turn, AI ethics is a part of the broader field of digital ethics, which addresses similar concerns generated by the development and deployment of new digital technologies. Here, we tackle the important worry that digital ethics in general, and AI ethics in particular, lack adequate philosophical foundations. In direct response to that worry, we formulate and rationally justify some basic concepts and principles for digital ethics/AI ethics, all drawn from a broadly Kantian theory of human dignity. Our argument, which is designed to be relatively compact and easily accessible, is presented in ten distinct steps: (1) what ""digital ethics"" and ""AI ethics"" mean, (2) refuting the dignity-skeptic, (3) the metaphysics of human dignity, (4) human happiness or flourishing, true human needs, and human dignity, (5) our moral obligations with respect to all human real persons, (6) what a natural automaton or natural machine is, (7) why human real persons are not natural automata/natural machines: because consciousness is a form of life, (8) our moral obligations with respect to the design and use of artificial automata or artificial machines, aka computers, and digital technology more generally, (9) what privacy is, why invasions of digital privacy are morally impermissible, whereas consensual entrances into digital privacy are either morally permissible or even obligatory, and finally (10) dignitarian morality versus legality, and digital ethics/AI ethics. We conclude by asserting our strongly-held belief that a well-founded and generally-accepted dignitarian digital ethics/AI ethics is of global existential importance for humanity.",0
"Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses were used to examine the neural correlates of prediction error in reinforcement learning. The findings are interpreted in the light of current computational models of learning and action selection. In this context, particular consideration is given to the comparison of activation patterns from studies using instrumental and Pavlovian conditioning, and where reinforcement involved rewarding or punishing feedback. The striatum was the key brain area encoding for prediction error, with activity encompassing dorsal and ventral regions for instrumental and Pavlovian reinforcement alike, a finding which challenges the functional separation of the striatum into a dorsal 'actor' and a ventral 'critic'. Prediction error activity was further observed in diverse areas of predominantly anterior cerebral cortex including medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. Distinct patterns of prediction error activity were found for studies using rewarding and aversive reinforcers; reward prediction errors were observed primarily in the striatum while aversive prediction errors were found more widely including insula and habenula.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a general term that implies the use of a computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention. AI is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots. The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci's lasting heritage is today's burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery, named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da Vinci's sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation. AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical statistics, and human biology-up to and including today's ""omics"". AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics approaches from deep learning information management to control of health management systems, including electronic health records, and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of their medical utility, economic value, and development of interdisciplinary strategies for their wider application.",0
"Protein aggregation can hinder the development, safety and efficacy of therapeutic antibody-based drugs. Developing a predictive model that evaluates aggregation behaviors during early stage development is therefore desirable. Machine learning is a widely used tool to train models that predict data with different attributes. However, most machine learning techniques require more data than is typically available in antibody development. In this work, we describe a rational feature selection framework to develop accurate models with a small number of features. We applied this framework to predict aggregation behaviors of 21 approved monospecific monoclonal antibodies at high concentration (150 mg/mL), yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.71 on validation tests with only two features using a linear model. The nearest neighbors and support vector regression models further improved the performance, which have correlation coefficients of 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. This framework can be extended to train other models that predict different physical properties.",0
"Radiologists typically spend long hours staring at the computer monitor. This unavoidable nature of our work can lead to detrimental effects on the eyes. Moreover, there is little awareness among radiologists with regards to such potential harm. Ocular hazards, such as computer vision syndrome, are increasingly becoming more relevant to the radiology community. In this article, we discuss the ocular occupational hazards faced by radiologists and suggestions that may help in minimizing such hazards.",0
"Fucoxanthin is a carotenoid that possesses various beneficial medicinal properties for human well-being. However, the current extraction technologies and quantification techniques are still lacking in terms of cost validation, high energy consumption, long extraction time, and low yield production. To date, artificial intelligence (AI) models can assist and improvise the bottleneck of fucoxanthin extraction and quantification process by establishing new technologies and processes which involve big data, digitalization, and automation for efficiency fucoxanthin production. This review highlights the application of AI models such as artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), capable of learning patterns and relationships from large datasets, capturing non-linearity, and predicting optimal conditions that significantly impact the fucoxanthin extraction yield. On top of that, combining metaheuristic algorithm such as genetic algorithm (GA) can further improve the parameter space and discovery of optimal conditions of ANN and ANFIS models, which results in high R2 accuracy ranging from 98.28% to 99.60% after optimization. Besides, AI models such as support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and ANN have been leveraged for the quantification of fucoxanthin, either computer vision based on color space of images or regression analysis based on statistical data. The findings are reliable when modeling for the concentration of pigments with high R2 accuracy ranging from 66.0% - 99.2%. This review paper has reviewed the feasibility and potential of AI for the extraction and quantification purposes, which can reduce the cost, accelerate the fucoxanthin yields, and development of fucoxanthin-based products.",0
"While frontal midline theta (FMθ) has been associated with threat processing, with cognitive control in the context of anxiety, and with reinforcement learning, most reinforcement learning studies on FMθ have used reward rather than threat-related stimuli as reinforcer. Accordingly, the role of FMθ in threat-related reinforcement learning is largely unknown. Here, n = 23 human participants underwent one reward-, and one punishment-, based reversal learning task, which differed only with regard to the kind of reinforcers that feedback was tied to (i.e., monetary gain vs. loud noise burst, respectively). In addition to single-trial EEG, we assessed single-trial feedback expectations based on both a reinforcement learning computational model and trial-by-trial subjective feedback expectation ratings. While participants' performance and feedback expectations were comparable between the reward and punishment tasks, FMθ was more reliably amplified to negative vs. positive feedback in the reward vs. punishment task. Regressions with feedback valence, computationally derived, and self-reported expectations as predictors and FMθ as criterion further revealed that trial-by-trial variations in FMθ specifically relate to reward-related feedback-valence and not to threat-related feedback or to violated expectations/prediction errors. These findings suggest that FMθ as measured in reinforcement learning tasks may be less sensitive to the processing of events with direct relevance for fear and anxiety.",0
"Purpose:
        
      
      Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing phenomenon poised to instigate large-scale changes in medicine. However, medical education has not kept pace with the rapid advancements of AI. Despite several calls to action, the adoption of teaching on AI in undergraduate medical education (UME) has been limited. This scoping review aims to identify gaps and key themes in the peer-reviewed literature on AI training in UME.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The scoping review was informed by Arksey and O'Malley's methodology. Seven electronic databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for articles discussing the inclusion of AI in UME between January 2000 and July 2020. A total of 4,299 articles were independently screened by 3 co-investigators and 22 full-text articles were included. Data were extracted using a standardized checklist. Themes were identified using iterative thematic analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The literature addressed: (1) a need for an AI curriculum in UME, (2) recommendations for AI curricular content including machine learning literacy and AI ethics, (3) suggestions for curriculum delivery, (4) an emphasis on cultivating ""uniquely human skills"" such as empathy in response to AI-driven changes, and (5) challenges with introducing an AI curriculum in UME. However, there was considerable heterogeneity and poor consensus across studies regarding AI curricular content and delivery.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite the large volume of literature, there is little consensus on what and how to teach AI in UME. Further research is needed to address these discrepancies and create a standardized framework of competencies that can facilitate greater adoption and implementation of a standardized AI curriculum in UME.",0
"Introduction:
        
      
      Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the potential to revolutionize medicine, offering vast improvements for plastic surgery. While human physicians are limited to one lifetime of experience, AI is poised to soon surpass human capabilities, as it draws on limitless information and continuous learning abilities. Nevertheless, as AI becomes increasingly prevalent in this domain, it gives rise to critical ethical considerations that must be addressed by professionals.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This work reviews the literature referring to the ethical challenges brought on by the ever-expanding use of AI in plastic surgery and offers guidelines for its application.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ethical challenges include the disclosure of use of AI by caregivers, validation of decision-making, data privacy, informed consent and autonomy, potential biases in AI systems, the opaque nature of AI models, questions of liability, and the need for regulations.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There is a lack of consensus for the ethical use of AI in plastic surgery. Guidelines, such as those presented in this work, are needed within each discipline of medicine to respond to important ethical considerations for the safe use of AI.

"Lately, the application or integration of Artificial Intelligence in various areas of the Healthcare domain has been a prime attraction; this includes diagnostics, medicine/drugs, medical devices, interventions/procedures, imaging, therapies as well as treatment regimes, and these areas are in direct relation with the patient care, which is the core subject of the improvements envisioned through the implementation of AI. Although carrying this practice with a focused objective of improvisation in providing quality care, the overall concept of such implementations misses the governance path which can comply with any available regulatory environment, which unfortunately at this stage does not exist. As these implementations would have a direct impact on patients care, there is an urgent need to institute a robust governance and compliance framework in order to ensure the efficacy, safety, privacy, and ethical considerations. The onus of pioneering this initiative of building a governance framework for the implementation of healthcare artificial intelligence primarily rests with the Food and Drug Authority of the respective country, it is also important for this authority to further organizing the governance framework in agreement or collaboration with other international authorities.",0
"In this article, our aim is to show why increasing the effectiveness of detecting doping fraud in sport by the use of artificial intelligence (AI) may be morally wrong. The first argument in favour of this conclusion is that using AI to make a non-ideal antidoping policy even more effective can be morally wrong. Whether the increased effectiveness is morally wrong depends on whether you believe that the current antidoping system administrated by the World Anti-Doping Agency is already morally wrong. The second argument is based on the possibility of scenarios in which a more effective AI system may be morally worse than a less effective but non-AI system. We cannot, of course, conclude that the increased effectiveness of doping detection is always morally wrong. But our point is that whether the introduction of AI to increase detection of doping fraud is a moral improvement depends on the moral plausibility of the current system and the distribution of harm that will follow from false positive and false negative errors.",0
"Stimuli associated with primary reinforcers appear themselves to acquire the capacity to strengthen behavior. This paper reviews research on the strengthening effects of conditioned reinforcers within the context of contemporary quantitative choice theories and behavioral momentum theory. Based partially on the finding that variations in parameters of conditioned reinforcement appear not to affect response strength as measured by resistance to change, long-standing assertions that conditioned reinforcers do not strengthen behavior in a reinforcement-like fashion are considered. A signposts or means-to-an-end account is explored and appears to provide a plausible alternative interpretation of the effects of stimuli associated with primary reinforcers. Related suggestions that primary reinforcers also might not have their effects via a strengthening process are explored and found to be worthy of serious consideration.",0
"The paper proposes a new class of nonlinear operators and a dual learning paradigm where optimization jointly concerns both linear convolutional weights and the parameters of these nonlinear operators. The nonlinear class proposed to perform a rich functional representation is composed by functions called rectified parametric sigmoid units. This class is constructed to benefit from the advantages of both sigmoid and rectified linear unit functions, while rejecting their respective drawbacks. Moreover, the analytic form of this new neural class involves scale, shift and shape parameters to obtain a wide range of activation shapes, including the standard rectified linear unit as a limit case. Parameters of this neural transfer class are considered as learnable for the sake of discovering the complex shapes that can contribute to solving machine learning issues. Performance achieved by the joint learning of convolutional and rectified parametric sigmoid learnable parameters are shown to be outstanding in both shallow and deep learning frameworks. This class opens new prospects with respect to machine learning in the sense that main learnable parameters are attached not only to linear transformations, but also to a wide range of nonlinear operators.",0
"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are providing an opportunity to enhance existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to improve patient safety and drive value-based imaging. We discuss the advantages and potential applications that may be realized with the synergy between AI and CDS systems. From the perspective of both radiologist and ordering provider, CDS could be significantly empowered using AI. CDS enhanced by AI could reduce friction in radiology workflows and can aid AI developers to identify relevant imaging features their tools should be seeking to extract from images. Furthermore, these systems can generate structured data to be used as input to develop machine learning algorithms, which can drive downstream care pathways. For referring providers, an AI-enabled CDS solution could enable an evolution from existing imaging-centric CDS toward decision support that takes into account a holistic patient perspective. More intelligent CDS could suggest imaging examinations in highly complex clinical scenarios, assist on the identification of appropriate imaging opportunities at the health system level, suggest appropriate individualized screening, or aid health care providers to ensure continuity of care. AI has the potential to enable the next generation of CDS, improving patient care and enhancing providers' and radiologists' experience.",0
"Embedded systems technology is undergoing a phase of transformation owing to the novel advancements in computer architecture and the breakthroughs in machine learning applications. The areas of applications of embedded machine learning (EML) include accurate computer vision schemes, reliable speech recognition, innovative healthcare, robotics, and more. However, there exists a critical drawback in the efficient implementation of ML algorithms targeting embedded applications. Machine learning algorithms are generally computationally and memory intensive, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments such as embedded and mobile devices. In order to efficiently implement these compute and memory-intensive algorithms within the embedded and mobile computing space, innovative optimization techniques are required at the algorithm and hardware levels. To this end, this survey aims at exploring current research trends within this circumference. First, we present a brief overview of compute intensive machine learning algorithms such as hidden Markov models (HMM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NNs), support vector machines (SVMs), Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), and deep neural networks (DNNs). Furthermore, we consider different optimization techniques currently adopted to squeeze these computational and memory-intensive algorithms within resource-limited embedded and mobile environments. Additionally, we discuss the implementation of these algorithms in microcontroller units, mobile devices, and hardware accelerators. Conclusively, we give a comprehensive overview of key application areas of EML technology, point out key research directions and highlight key take-away lessons for future research exploration in the embedded machine learning domain.",0
"As a data-driven science, genomics largely utilizes machine learning to capture dependencies in data and derive novel biological hypotheses. However, the ability to extract new insights from the exponentially increasing volume of genomics data requires more expressive machine learning models. By effectively leveraging large data sets, deep learning has transformed fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. Now, it is becoming the method of choice for many genomics modelling tasks, including predicting the impact of genetic variation on gene regulatory mechanisms such as DNA accessibility and splicing.",0
"The development of digital pathology and progression of state-of-the-art algorithms for computer vision have led to increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL)-based AI, in tumor pathology. The DL-based algorithms have been developed to conduct all kinds of work involved in tumor pathology, including tumor diagnosis, subtyping, grading, staging, and prognostic prediction, as well as the identification of pathological features, biomarkers and genetic changes. The applications of AI in pathology not only contribute to improve diagnostic accuracy and objectivity but also reduce the workload of pathologists and subsequently enable them to spend additional time on high-level decision-making tasks. In addition, AI is useful for pathologists to meet the requirements of precision oncology. However, there are still some challenges relating to the implementation of AI, including the issues of algorithm validation and interpretability, computing systems, the unbelieving attitude of pathologists, clinicians and patients, as well as regulators and reimbursements. Herein, we present an overview on how AI-based approaches could be integrated into the workflow of pathologists and discuss the challenges and perspectives of the implementation of AI in tumor pathology.",0
"Deep learning has become a predominant method for solving data analysis problems in virtually all fields of science and engineering. The increasing complexity and the large volume of data collected by diverse sensor systems have spurred the development of deep learning methods and have fundamentally transformed the way the data are acquired, processed, analyzed, and interpreted. With the rapid development of deep learning technology and its ever-increasing range of successful applications across diverse sensor systems, there is an urgent need to provide a comprehensive investigation of deep learning in this domain from a holistic view. This survey paper aims to contribute to this by systematically investigating deep learning models/methods and their applications across diverse sensor systems. It also provides a comprehensive summary of deep learning implementation tips and links to tutorials, open-source codes, and pretrained models, which can serve as an excellent self-contained reference for deep learning practitioners and those seeking to innovate deep learning in this space. In addition, this paper provides insights into research topics in diverse sensor systems where deep learning has not yet been well-developed, and highlights challenges and future opportunities. This survey serves as a catalyst to accelerate the application and transformation of deep learning in diverse sensor systems.",0
"Background and Objectives: With the increased prevalence of patients with cancer, the demand for preparing cytotoxic drugs was increased by health-system pharmacists. To reduce the workload and contamination of work areas in pharmacies, compounding robots preparing cytotoxic drugs have been introduced, and the use of the robots has been expanded in recent years. As reports on the comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of compounding robots remain lacking, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to provide descriptive and quantitative evaluations of the accuracy of preparing injectable cytotoxic drugs. Materials and Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using published studies up to 2020. To identify eligible studies, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were used. All studies reporting the outcomes relevant to drug-compounding robots such as accuracy, safety, and drug contamination were included. Outcomes from included studies were descriptively summarized. Drug contamination by the robot was quantitatively analyzed using the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies (RoBANS). Results: A total of 14 compounding robot studies were eligible for review and 4 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Robotic compounding showed failure rates of 0.9-16.75%, while the accuracy range was set at 5%. Two studies reported that robotic compounding needed more time than manual compounding, two reported that robotic compounding needed less time, and one just reported preparation time without a control group. In a meta-analysis regarding the contamination of the compounding area, manual compounding was associated with lower contamination, although the result was not statistically significant (OR 4.251, 95% CI 0.439-51.772). For the contamination of infusion bags, the robot was associated with lower contamination (OR 0.176, 95% CI 0.084-0.365). Conclusions: Robotic compounding showed better accuracy than manual compounding and, without control groups, showed a high accuracy rate and also reduced the risk of drug contamination and compounding workload. The preparation time of the robot was not consistent because the type of robot and introduced system were different. In conclusion, robotic compounding showed mixed results compared to the manual compounding of drugs, so the system should be introduced considering the risks and benefits of robots.",0
"The review presents key concepts and global developments in the field of artificial intelligence used in pathological anatomy. The work examines two types of artificial intelligence (AI): weak and strong ones. A review of experimental algorithms using both deep machine learning and computer vision technologies to work with WSI images of preparations, diagnose and make a prognosis for various malignant neoplasms is carried out. It has been established that weak artificial intelligence at this stage of development of computer (digital) pathological anatomy shows significantly better results in speeding up and refining diagnostic procedures than strong artificial intelligence having signs of general intelligence. The article also discusses three options for the further development of AI assistants for pathologists based on the technologies of large language models (strong AI) ChatGPT (PathAsst), Flan-PaLM2 and LIMA. As a result of the analysis of the literature, key problems in the field were identified: the equipment of pathology institutions, the lack of experts in training neural networks, the lack of strict criteria for the clinical viability of AI diagnostic technologies.",0
"Technological advances are enabling roles for machines that present novel ethical challenges. The study of 'AI ethics' has emerged to confront these challenges, and connects perspectives from philosophy, computer science, law, and economics. Less represented in these interdisciplinary efforts is the perspective of cognitive science. We propose a framework - computational ethics - that specifies how the ethical challenges of AI can be partially addressed by incorporating the study of human moral decision-making. The driver of this framework is a computational version of reflective equilibrium (RE), an approach that seeks coherence between considered judgments and governing principles. The framework has two goals: (i) to inform the engineering of ethical AI systems, and (ii) to characterize human moral judgment and decision-making in computational terms. Working jointly towards these two goals will create the opportunity to integrate diverse research questions, bring together multiple academic communities, uncover new interdisciplinary research topics, and shed light on centuries-old philosophical questions.",0
"In this paper, a neural networks model for quantum computer is proposed. The core of this model is quantum neuron. Firstly, the inner product of the input qubits and the weight qubits is mapped to the phase of the control qubits in the neuron by the swap test technology, and then these phases are obtained by the phase estimation method, which are further used as the phase of the output qubit in the neuron. In this way, the mapping of input qubits to output qubit in quantum neuron is completed. The quantum neurons mentioned above can be used to construct quantum neural networks. In this paper, the quantum circuit for each operation step are given. The simulation results on the classic computer verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.",0
"The use of robots has revolutionized healthcare, wherein further innovations have led to improved precision and accuracy. Conceived in the late 1960s, robot-assisted surgeries have evolved to become an integral part of various surgical specialties. Modern robotic surgical systems are equipped with highly dexterous arms and miniaturized instruments that reduce tremors and enable delicate maneuvers. Implementation of advanced materials and designs along with the integration of imaging and visualization technologies have enhanced surgical accuracy and made robots safer and more adaptable to various procedures. Further, the haptic feedback system allows surgeons to determine the consistency of the tissues they are operating upon, without physical contact, thereby preventing injuries due to the application of excess force. With the implementation of teleoperation, surgeons can now overcome geographical limitations and provide specialized healthcare remotely. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) aids in surgical decision-making by improving the recognition of minute and complex anatomical structures. All these advancements have led to faster recovery and fewer complications in patients. However, the substantial cost of robotic systems, their maintenance, the size of the systems and proper surgeon training pose major challenges. Nevertheless, with future advancements such as AI-driven automation, nanorobots, microscopic incision surgeries, semi-automated telerobotic systems, and the impact of 5G connectivity on remote surgery, the growth curve of robotic surgery points to innovation and stands as a testament to the persistent pursuit of progress in healthcare.",0
"Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the current place of robotics in laparoscopic urological surgery.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      A review of the international literature was conducted to evaluate the various available endoscope robot systems and telemanipulator robots and to establish their practical limitations and their contribution to surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Robotic systems are based on various structures, which each present specific disadvantages. Two types of systems can be distinguished: endoscope robots and telemanipulator robots (complete robotic systems) with different degrees of complexity, dimensions and costs. Each system is different in terms of service rendered. Endoscope robot systems (EndoAssist, AESOP, LapMan) are reliable and eliminate the need for an assistant to hold the camera. Man-machine interfaces can be manual, by pedal or by voice recognition. They are relatively large and expensive, limiting their diffusion at the present time. Complete instrument-handling robots (master-slave manipulators) are currently represented by 2 robots (Zeus and Da Vinci) which have demonstrated their efficacy in many difficult operations. Their very high cost and their large dimensions also constitute limitations to their diffusion, making them inaccessible to the majority of centres. The urological community has largely contributed to the evaluation of robots in laparoscopic operations, as reflected by the large number of publications.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Considerable technological progress has been made over recent years to make laparoscopic surgery more accessible. Current robotized tools are still imperfect systems, but, in the future, may possibly facilitate difficult laparoscopic operations, particularly in urology.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) contributes to common goods and common harms in our everyday lives. In light of the Collingridge dilemma, information about both the actual and potential harm of AI is explored and myths about AI are dispelled.

"Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have become a part of our daily routine. There are very few of us who are not influenced by this technology. There are a lot of misconceptions about the scope, utility, and fallacies of AI. Digital neuropathology is an evolving area of research. The importance of digital image processing stems from the rapid gains in computer vision and image processing that have happened in the past decade thanks to advancements in deep learning (DL). The article attempts to present to the audience a simple presentation of the technology and attempts to provide a context-based understanding of the DL process for image processing. Also highlighted are current challenges and the roadblocks in adopting the technology in routine neuropathology.",0
"Batch effects (BEs) are technical biases that may confound analysis of high-throughput biotechnological data. BEs are complex and effective mitigation is highly context-dependent. In particular, the advent of high-resolution technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing presents new challenges. We first cover how BE modeling differs between traditional datasets and the new data landscape. We also discuss new approaches for measuring and mitigating BEs, including whether a BE is significant enough to warrant correction. Even with the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the increased complexity of next-generation biotechnological data means increased complexities in BE management. We forecast that BEs will not only remain relevant in the age of big data but will become even more important.",0
"In this paper we present the alpha-prototype of a novel pediatric ankle robot. This lower-extremity robotic therapy module was developed at MIT to aid recovery of ankle function in children with cerebral palsy ages 5 to 8 years old. This lower-extremity robotic module will commence pilot testing with children with cerebral palsy at Blythedale Childrens Hospital (Valhalla, NY), Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital (Rome, Italy), Riley Children's Hospital (Indianapolis, IN). Its design follows the same guidelines as our upper-extremity robots and adult anklebot designs, i.e. it is a low friction, backdriveable device with intrinsically low mechanical impedance. We show the ankle robot characteristics and stability range. We also present pilot data with healthy children to demonstrate the potential of this device.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Sixty-four to 90% of computer users experience symptoms of computer vision syndrome (CVS). People with CVS symptoms experience neck pain (NP), and people with NP can have visual symptoms.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      (1) To examine differences in CVS symptoms in computer users with and without persistent NP. (2) To determine relationships between visual ergonomics, demographics, and CVS in those with and without persistent NP DESIGN: Comparative cross-sectional observational study METHOD: An online survey consisting of multiple questionnaires including the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire (CVS-Q), Visual Symptoms Survey (VSS), and Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey (CISS) was completed by 167 participants.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The persistent NP group had significantly higher CVS-Q, VSS, and CISS scores (p <0.01) compared to controls. No relationships were found between visual ergonomics, demographics, and visual symptoms in both groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      People with persitent NP are more likely to present with CVS than controls. Clinicians should consider assessing visual symptoms in people presenting with persisting NP.",0
"Advancements in technology and data collection generated immense amounts of information from various sources such as health records, clinical examination, imaging, medical devices, as well as experimental and biological data. Proper management and analysis of these data via high-end computing solutions, artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches can assist in extracting meaningful information that enhances population health and well-being. Furthermore, the extracted knowledge can provide new avenues for modern healthcare delivery via clinical decision support systems. This manuscript presents a narrative review of data science approaches for clinical decision support systems in orthodontics. We describe the fundamental components of data science approaches including (a) Data collection, storage and management; (b) Data processing; (c) In-depth data analysis; and (d) Data communication. Then, we introduce a web-based data management platform, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration, for temporomandibular joint and dental clinical decision support systems.",0
"Big Data is on the verge of explosion in terms of popularity in recent decades, and such a trend is not going to stop anytime soon as it has a lot of room to grow. The increased integration of IoT devices, faster access to the Internet, and advances in the computational power of mainstream devices have drastically increased the feasibility for the same while making it more practical to implement gradually. The reach and applicability of Big Data are diversified, yet widespread, and one of its key implementations falls under the environment arena. In an attempt to provide novel Big Data allied solutions in one or more aspects of water management sector, a substantial amount of research work has been carried out in recent years. This paper discusses how Big Data influences the abovementioned arenas and the extent of importance that it has. Several aspects of this field are uprooted, are discussed, and have seen real-world applicability. Various presently deployed applications, in the sub-fields of environment and water management are studied, and given an inclusive review. Finally, the current challenges and limitations pertaining to Big Data are discussed and proper (in theory) solutions are proposed which seem to have promising results. The future scope of Big Data is also considered with its viability taken into consideration. Several assessments and opinions are then cited.",0
"In recent years, several neural networks using Clifford algebra have been studied. Clifford algebra is also called geometric algebra. Complex-valued Hopfield neural networks (CHNNs) are the most popular neural networks using Clifford algebra. The aim of this brief is to construct hyperbolic HNNs (HHNNs) as an analog of CHNNs. Hyperbolic algebra is a Clifford algebra based on Lorentzian geometry. In this brief, a hyperbolic neuron is defined in a manner analogous to a phasor neuron, which is a typical complex-valued neuron model. HHNNs share common concepts with CHNNs, such as the angle and energy. However, HHNNs and CHNNs are different in several aspects. The states of hyperbolic neurons do not form a circle, and, therefore, the start and end states are not identical. In the quantized version, unlike complex-valued neurons, hyperbolic neurons have an infinite number of states.",0
"Resurgence is the recurrence of a previously reinforced and then extinguished behavior induced by the extinction of another more recently reinforced behavior. Resurgence provides insight into behavioral processes relevant to treatment relapse of a range of problem behaviors. Resurgence is typically studied across three phases: (1) reinforcement of a target response, (2) extinction of the target and concurrent reinforcement of an alternative response, and (3) extinction of the alternative response, resulting in the recurrence of target responding. Because each phase typically occurs successively and spans multiple sessions, extended time frames separate the training and resurgence of target responding. This study assessed resurgence more dynamically and throughout ongoing training in 6 pigeons. Baseline entailed 50-s trials of a free-operant psychophysical procedure, resembling Phases 1 and 2 of typical resurgence procedures. During the first 25 s, we reinforced target (left-key) responding but not alternative (right-key) responding; contingencies reversed during the second 25 s. Target and alternative responding followed the baseline reinforcement contingencies, with alternative responding replacing target responding across the 50 s. We observed resurgence of target responding during signaled and unsignaled probes that extended trial durations an additional 100 s in extinction. Furthermore, resurgence was greater and/or sooner when probes were signaled, suggesting an important role of discriminating transitions to extinction in resurgence. The data were well described by an extension of a stimulus-control model of discrimination that assumes resurgence is the result of generalization of obtained reinforcers across space and time. Therefore, the present findings introduce novel methods and quantitative analyses for assessing behavioral processes underlying resurgence.",0
"Insight into current scientific applications of Big Data in the precision dairy farming area may help us to understand the inflated expectations around Big Data. The objective of this invited review paper is to give that scientific background and determine whether Big Data has overcome the peak of inflated expectations. A conceptual model was created, and a literature search in Scopus resulted in 1442 scientific peer reviewed papers. After thorough screening on relevance and classification by the authors, 142 papers remained for further analysis. The area of precision dairy farming (with classes in the primary chain (dairy farm, feed, breed, health, food, retail, consumer) and levels for object of interest (animal, farm, network)), the Big Data-V area (with categories on Volume, Velocity, Variety and other V's) and the data analytics area (with categories in analysis methods (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised classification, reinforcement learning) and data characteristics (time-series, streaming, sequence, graph, spatial, multimedia)) were analysed. The animal sublevel, with 83% of the papers, exceeds the farm sublevel and network sublevel. Within the animal sublevel, topics within the dairy farm level prevailed with 58% over the health level (33%). Within the Big Data category, the Volume category was most favoured with 59% of the papers, followed by 37% of papers that included the Variety category. None of the papers included the Velocity category. Supervised learning, representing 87% of the papers, exceeds unsupervised learning (12%). Within supervised learning, 64% of the papers dealt with classification issues and exceeds the regression methods (36%). Time-series were used in 61% of the papers and were mostly dealing with animal-based farm data. Multimedia data appeared in a greater number of recent papers. Based on these results, it can be concluded that Big Data is a relevant topic of research within the precision dairy farming area, but that the full potential of Big Data in this precision dairy farming area is not utilised yet. However, the present authors expect the full potential of Big Data, within the precision dairy farming area, will be reached when multiple Big Data characteristics (Volume, Variety and other V's) and sources (animal, groups, farms and chain parts) are used simultaneously, adding value to operational and strategic decision.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Infectious keratitis (IK) is a sight-threatening condition requiring immediate definite treatment. The need for prompt treatment heavily depends on timely diagnosis. The diagnosis of IK, however, is challenged by the drawbacks of the current ""gold standard."" The poorly differentiated clinical features, the possibility of low microbial culture yield, and the duration for culture are the culprits of delayed IK treatment. Deep learning (DL) is a recent artificial intelligence (AI) advancement that has been demonstrated to be highly promising in making automated diagnosis in IK with high accuracy. However, its exact accuracy is not yet elucidated. This article is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that aims to assess the accuracy of available DL models to correctly classify IK based on etiology compared to the current gold standards.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Google Scholars, Proquest, ScienceDirect, Cochrane and Scopus. The used keywords are: ""Keratitis,"" ""Corneal ulcer,"" ""Corneal diseases,"" ""Corneal lesions,"" ""Artificial intelligence,"" ""Deep learning,"" and ""Machine learning."" Studies including slit lamp photography of the cornea and validity study on DL performance were considered. The primary outcomes reviewed were the accuracy and classification capability of the AI machine learning/DL algorithm. We analyzed the extracted data with the MetaXL 5.2 Software.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of eleven articles from 2002 to 2022 were included with a total dataset of 34,070 images. All studies used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with ResNet and DenseNet models being the most used models across studies. Most AI models outperform the human counterparts with a pooled area under the curve (AUC) of 0.851 and accuracy of 96.6% in differentiating IK vs. non-IK and pooled AUC 0.895 and accuracy of 64.38% for classifying bacterial keratitis (BK) vs. fungal keratitis (FK).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study demonstrated that DL algorithms have high potential in diagnosing and classifying IK with accuracy that, if not better, is comparable to trained corneal experts. However, various factors, such as the unique architecture of DL model, the problem with overfitting, image quality of the datasets, and the complex nature of IK itself, still hamper the universal applicability of DL in daily clinical practice.",0
"Data federation offers a way to get data moving from multiple sources providing advantages in healthcare systems where medical data is often hard to reach because of regulations or the lack of reliable solutions that can integrate on top of protocols like FHIR, HL7, DICOM, among others. Given the increasing need for solutions that augment healthcare systems with artificial intelligence (AI), in fields like genomics, cancer treatment, and radiology, all of which will require solutions that can provide data at scale while being traceable, safe, and regulatory-compliant.

"Advancements in high-throughput sequencing have yielded vast amounts of genomic data, which are studied using genome-wide association study (GWAS)/phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) methods to identify associations between the genotype and phenotype. The associated findings have contributed to pharmacogenomics and improved clinical decision support at the point of care in many healthcare systems. However, the accumulation of genomic data from sequencing and clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs) poses significant challenges for data scientists. Following the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technology such as machine learning and deep learning, an increasing number of GWAS/PheWAS studies have successfully leveraged this technology to overcome the aforementioned challenges. In this review, we focus on the application of data science and AI technology in three areas, including risk prediction and identification of causal single-nucleotide polymorphisms, EHR-based phenotyping and CRISPR guide RNA design. Additionally, we highlight a few emerging AI technologies, such as transfer learning and multi-view learning, which will or have started to benefit genomic studies.",0
"Significance:
        
      
      After 6 to 8 weeks of mandatory lockdown due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Spain, the encouraged change in daily habits resulted in a significant increase in electronic device use. Computer vision syndrome-related symptoms were reported more often in participants who used electronic device for more time and spent less time outdoors.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      The main purpose of this study was to evaluate computer vision syndrome-related eye symptoms due to the use of electronic devices during COVID-19 lockdown decreed in Spain in 2020.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      After 6 to 8 weeks of strict lockdown, a total of 730 participants (18 to 73 years old) filled in a customized questionnaire divided into three sections: (1) general demographics, (2) usage habits of electronic devices during this period, and (3) computer vision syndrome-related ocular and visual symptoms associated with their use and with ergonomic practices.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The daily duration of use of electronic devices increased an average of 3.1 ± 2.2 h/d during the lockdown, with computer use increasing the most. The main symptoms reported by the participants were headache (36.7%), dry eye (31.1%), irritation (24.1%), blurred vision (21.2%), and ocular pain (14.9%). There was a significant relationship between computer vision syndrome-related symptoms and age (greater in participants between 18 and 30 years old than in those older than 45 years, P < .001), primary activity (greater in studying from home and remote working, P < .001), and extended periods of electronic device use (greater when used more than 10 h/d, P = .05). Symptoms were also associated with time spent outdoors (greater in participants with <1 h/d, P = .02).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The lockdown due to COVID-19 showed an increase in the electronic device use. Participants who spent more time with electronic devices and less time outdoors reported more computer vision syndrome-related eye symptoms.",0
"Background:

"Many researchers have documented how AI and data driven technologies have the potential to have profound effects on our lives-in ways that make these technologies stand out from those that went before. Around the world, we are seeing a significant growth in interest and investment in AI in healthcare. This has been coupled with rising concerns about the ethical implications of these technologies and an array of ethical guidelines for the use of AI and data in healthcare has arisen. Nevertheless, the question of if and how AI and data technologies can be ethical remains open to debate. This paper aims to contribute to this debate by considering the wide range of implications that have been attributed to these technologies and asking whether current ethical guidelines take these factors into account. In particular, the paper argues that while current ethics guidelines for AI in healthcare effectively account for the four key issues identified in the ethics literature (transparency; fairness; responsibility and privacy), they have largely neglected wider issues relating to the way in which these technologies shape institutional and social arrangements. This, I argue, has given current ethics guidelines a strong focus on evaluating the impact of these technologies on the individual, while not accounting for the powerful social shaping effects of these technologies. To address this, the paper proposes a Multiscale Ethics Framework, which aims to help technology developers and ethical evaluations to consider the wider implications of these technologies.",0
"A long standing open problem in the theory of neural networks is the development of quantitative methods to estimate and compare the capabilities of different architectures. Here we define the capacity of an architecture by the binary logarithm of the number of functions it can compute, as the synaptic weights are varied. The capacity provides an upperbound on the number of bits that can be extracted from the training data and stored in the architecture during learning. We study the capacity of layered, fully-connected, architectures of linear threshold neurons with L layers of size n1,n2,…,nL and show that in essence the capacity is given by a cubic polynomial in the layer sizes: C(n1,…,nL)=∑k=1L-1min(n1,…,nk)nknk+1, where layers that are smaller than all previous layers act as bottlenecks. In proving the main result, we also develop new techniques (multiplexing, enrichment, and stacking) as well as new bounds on the capacity of finite sets. We use the main result to identify architectures with maximal or minimal capacity under a number of natural constraints. This leads to the notion of structural regularization for deep architectures. While in general, everything else being equal, shallow networks compute more functions than deep networks, the functions computed by deep networks are more regular and ""interesting"".",0
"Artificial Intelligence in Radiology - Definition, Potential and Challenges Abstract. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is omnipresent. It has neatly permeated our daily life, even if we are not always fully aware of its ubiquitous presence. The healthcare sector in particular is experiencing a revolution which will change our daily routine considerably in the near future. Due to its advanced digitization and its historical technical affinity radiology is especially prone to these developments. But what exactly is AI and what makes AI so potent that established medical disciplines such as radiology worry about their future job perspectives? What are the assets of AI in radiology today - and what are the major challenges? This review article tries to give some answers to these questions.",0
"Gene regulation is a central topic in cell biology. Advances in omics technologies and the accumulation of omics data have provided better opportunities for gene regulation studies than ever before. For this reason deep learning, as a data-driven predictive modeling approach, has been successfully applied to this field during the past decade. In this article, we aim to give a brief yet comprehensive overview of representative deep-learning methods for gene regulation. Specifically, we discuss and compare the design principles and datasets used by each method, creating a reference for researchers who wish to replicate or improve existing methods. We also discuss the common problems of existing approaches and prospectively introduce the emerging deep-learning paradigms that will potentially alleviate them. We hope that this article will provide a rich and up-to-date resource and shed light on future research directions in this area.",0
"Metabolite identification is a crucial part of the drug discovery process. LC-MS/MS-based metabolite identification has gained widespread use, but the data acquired by the LC-MS/MS instrument is complex, and thus the interpretation of data becomes troublesome. Fortunately, advancements in data mining techniques have simplified the process of data interpretation with improved mass accuracy and provide a potentially selective, sensitive, accurate and comprehensive way for metabolite identification. In this review, we have discussed the targeted (extracted ion chromatogram, mass defect filter, product ion filter, neutral loss filter and isotope pattern filter) and untargeted (control sample comparison, background subtraction and metabolomic approaches) post-acquisition data mining techniques, which facilitate the drug metabolite identification. We have also discussed the importance of integrated data mining strategy.",0
"Food is an important determinant of health, featuring prominently in the Sustainable Development Goals. The term ""big data"" is seldom used in relation to food, partly because food data are scattered across different sectors. The increasing availability of food-related data presents an opportunity to glean new insights on food and food systems. These insights may enhance the quality of products and services and improve decision-making on optimizing food availability, all to the end of producing better health. Yet, knowledge gaps remain about the unique opportunities and challenges linked to big data on food and their use in decision-making. This scoping review explored the available literature linking food with big data and decision-making, using the following research question: What is the current literature on data about food, and how are these data used in decision-making? We searched PubMed until 29 February 2020 and Embase, Web of Sciences, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews until 8 March 2020. We included studies written in English and conducted narrative analyses to identify relevant themes from included studies. Sixteen studies fulfilled our eligibility criteria, including big data analyses, modelling studies, and reviews. These studies described the added value of using big data and how evidence from big data had or can be used for decision-making, as well as challenges and opportunities for such use. The majority of the included studies examined the link between food and big data, while hypothesizing of how these insights could inform decision-making, including policies, interventions, programs, and financing. There were only two examples wherein big data on food informed decision-making directly. The review highlights several false dichotomies in how the subject is approached in the literature and the importance of context, both between and within countries, in shaping the availability and types of data that can be used as meaningful evidence to inform decision-making. This review shows the paucity of research around the intersection of food, big data, and decision-making, as well as the potential in using big data on food systems to the end of informing decisions to improve the health of populations. Future research and decision-making around health systems can benefit from examining the full spectrum of perspectives on the subject. Future research and decision-making around health systems can also employ the steadfast embrace of technology, which will potentially reduce disparities in big data availability, to the end of improving the health of populations.",0
"Image's noise, edge and contrast are the important factors that influence image's quality. If a method of image enhancement is solely applied to the degraded medical digital image, image's quality is improved in part, if a combined method of image enhancement is applied to the degraded medical digital image, it can increase the image's quality greatly.",0
"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central to cellular functions. Experimental methods for predicting PPIs are well developed but are time and resource expensive and suffer from high false-positive error rates at scale. Computational prediction of PPIs is highly desirable for a mechanistic understanding of cellular processes and offers the potential to identify highly selective drug targets. In this chapter, details of developing a deep learning approach to predicting which residues in a protein are involved in forming a PPI-a task known as PPI site prediction-are outlined. The key decisions to be made in defining a supervised machine learning project in this domain are here highlighted. Alternative training regimes for deep learning models to address shortcomings in existing approaches and provide starting points for further research are discussed. This chapter is written to serve as a companion to developing deep learning approaches to protein-protein interaction site prediction, and an introduction to developing geometric deep learning projects operating on protein structure graphs.",0
"In this study, a new approach for time series based condition monitoring and fault diagnosis based on bidirectional recurrent neural networks is presented. The application of bidirectional recurrent neural networks essentially provide a viewpoint change on the fault diagnosis task, which allows to handle fault relations over longer time horizons helping in avoiding critical process breakdowns and increasing the overall productivity of the system. To further enhance the capability, we propose a novel procedure of data preprocessing and restructuring which enforces the generalization and a more efficient data utilization and consequently yields more efficient network training, especially for sequential fault classification task. The proposed Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory network outperforms standard recurrent architectures including vanilla recurrent neural networks, Long Short Term Memories and Gated Recurrent Units. We apply the proposed approach to the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process to test the effectiveness of the mentioned deep architectures and provide a detailed comparative analysis. The experimental results for binary as well as multi-class classification show the superior average fault detection capability of the bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Networks compared to the other architectures and to results from other state-of-the-art architectures found in the literature.",0

"Background:
        
      
      Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into separate objects or regions. It is an essential step in image processing to segment the regions of interest for further processing. We propose a method for segmenting the nuclei and cytoplasms from white blood cells (WBCs).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Initially, the method computes an initial value based on the minimum and maximum values of the input image. Then, a histogram of the input image is computed and approximated to obtain function values. The method searches for the first local maximum and local minimum from the approximated function values in the order of increasing of knots sequence. We approximate the required threshold from the first local minimum and the computed initial value based on defined conditions. The threshold is applied to the input image to binarize it, and then post-processing is performed to obtain the final segmented nucleus. We segment the whole WBC before segmenting the cytoplasm depending on the complexity of the objects in the image. For WBCs that are well separated from red blood cells (RBCs), n thresholds are generated and then produce n thresholded images. Then, a standard Otsu method is used to binarize the average of the produced images. Morphological operations are applied on the binarized image, and then a single-pixel point from the segmented nucleus is used to segment the WBC. For images in which RBCs touch the WBCs, we segment the whole WBC using SLIC and watershed methods. The cytoplasm is obtained by subtracting the segmented nucleus from the segmented WBC.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The method is tested on two different public data sets and the results are compared to the state of art methods. The performance analysis shows that the proposed method segments the nucleus and cytoplasm well.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We propose a method for nucleus and cytoplasm segmentation based on the local minima of the approximated function values from the image's histogram. The method has demonstrated its utility in segmenting nuclei, WBCs, and cytoplasm, and the results are satisfactory.",0

"Photovoltaic (PV) cell defect detection has become a prominent problem in the development of the PV industry; however, the entire industry lacks effective technical means. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based defect detection method for photovoltaic cells, which addresses two technical challenges: (1) to propose a method for data enhancement and category weight assignment, which effectively mitigates the impact of the problem of scant data and data imbalance on model performance; (2) to propose a feature fusion method based on ResNet152-Xception. A coordinate attention (CA) mechanism is incorporated into the feature map to enhance the feature extraction capability of the existing model. The proposed model was conducted on two global publicly available PV-defective electroluminescence (EL) image datasets, and using CNN, Vgg16, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, ResNet152, Xception and InceptionResNetV2 as comparative benchmarks, it was evaluated that several metrics were significantly improved. In addition, the accuracy reached 96.17% in the binary classification task of identifying the presence or absence of defects and 92.13% in the multiclassification task of identifying different defect types. The numerical experimental results show that the proposed deep-learning-based defect detection method for PV cells can automatically perform efficient and accurate defect detection using EL images.",0

"The emergence of COVID-19 has had a global and profound impact, not only on society as a whole, but also on the lives of individuals. Various prevention measures were introduced around the world to limit the transmission of the disease, including face masks, mandates for social distancing and regular disinfection in public spaces, and the use of screening applications. These developments also triggered the need for novel and improved computer vision techniques capable of ( i )  providing support to the prevention measures through an automated analysis of visual data, on the one hand, and ( ii )  facilitating normal operation of existing vision-based services, such as biometric authentication schemes, on the other. Especially important here, are computer vision techniques that focus on the analysis of people and faces in visual data and have been affected the most by the partial occlusions introduced by the mandates for facial masks. Such computer vision based human analysis techniques include face and face-mask detection approaches, face recognition techniques, crowd counting solutions, age and expression estimation procedures, models for detecting face-hand interactions and many others, and have seen considerable attention over recent years. The goal of this survey is to provide an introduction to the problems induced by COVID-19 into such research and to present a comprehensive review of the work done in the computer vision based human analysis field. Particular attention is paid to the impact of facial masks on the performance of various methods and recent solutions to mitigate this problem. Additionally, a detailed review of existing datasets useful for the development and evaluation of methods for COVID-19 related applications is also provided. Finally, to help advance the field further, a discussion on the main open challenges and future research direction is given at the end of the survey. This work is intended to have a broad appeal and be useful not only for computer vision researchers but also the general public.",0

While some psychologists may be familiar with dictionary methods, fewer may be aware of approaches like topic modeling, word embeddings, and more advanced neural network language models. This article provides an overview of natural language processing and how it can be used to deepen understanding of people and culture. We outline the dual role of language (i.e., reflecting things about producers and impacting audiences), review some useful text analysis methods, and discuss how these approaches can help unlock a range of interesting questions.

"The growing awareness of the influence of ""what we eat"" on lifestyle and health has led to an increase in the use of embedded food analysis and recognition systems. These solutions aim to effectively monitor daily food consumption, and therefore provide dietary recommendations to enable and support lifestyle changes. Mobile applications, due to their high accessibility, are ideal for real-life food recognition, volume estimation and calorific estimation. In this study, we conducted a systematic review based on articles that proposed mobile computer vision-based solutions for food recognition, volume estimation and calorific estimation. In addition, we assessed the extent to which these applications provide explanations to aid the users to understand the related classification and/or predictions. Our results show that 90.9% of applications do not distinguish between food and non-food. Similarly, only one study that proposed a mobile computer vision-based application for dietary intake attempted to provide explanations of features that contribute towards classification. Mobile computer vision-based applications are attracting a lot of interest in healthcare. They have the potential to assist in the management of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, ensuring that patients eat healthily and reducing complications associated with unhealthy food. However, to improve trust, mobile computer vision-based applications in healthcare should provide explanations of how they derive their classifications or volume and calorific estimations.",0

"Regardless of how much data artificial intelligence agents have available, agents will inevitably encounter previously unseen situations in real-world deployments. Reacting to novel situations by acquiring new information from other people-socially situated learning-is a core faculty of human development. Unfortunately, socially situated learning remains an open challenge for artificial intelligence agents because they must learn how to interact with people to seek out the information that they lack. In this article, we formalize the task of socially situated artificial intelligence-agents that seek out new information through social interactions with people-as a reinforcement learning problem where the agent learns to identify meaningful and informative questions via rewards observed through social interaction. We manifest our framework as an interactive agent that learns how to ask natural language questions about photos as it broadens its visual intelligence on a large photo-sharing social network. Unlike active-learning methods, which implicitly assume that humans are oracles willing to answer any question, our agent adapts its behavior based on observed norms of which questions people are or are not interested to answer. Through an 8-mo deployment where our agent interacted with 236,000 social media users, our agent improved its performance at recognizing new visual information by 112%. A controlled field experiment confirmed that our agent outperformed an active-learning baseline by 25.6%. This work advances opportunities for continuously improving artificial intelligence (AI) agents that better respect norms in open social environments.",0
"Animals exploit soft structures to move effectively in complex natural environments. These capabilities have inspired robotic engineers to incorporate soft technologies into their designs. The goal is to endow robots with new, bioinspired capabilities that permit adaptive, flexible interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review emerging soft-bodied robotic systems, and in particular recent developments inspired by soft-bodied animals. Incorporating soft technologies can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic complexity involved in robot design. Incorporating soft technologies will also expedite the evolution of robots that can safely interact with humans and natural environments. Finally, soft robotics technology can be combined with tissue engineering to create hybrid systems for medical applications.",0
"Has the rise of data-intensive science, or 'big data', revolutionized our ability to predict? Does it imply a new priority for prediction over causal understanding, and a diminished role for theory and human experts? I examine four important cases where prediction is desirable: political elections, the weather, GDP, and the results of interventions suggested by economic experiments. These cases suggest caution. Although big data methods are indeed very useful sometimes, in this paper's cases they improve predictions either limitedly or not at all, and their prospects of doing so in the future are limited too.",0
"The use of robotic technologies to assist surgeons was conceptually described almost thirty years ago but has only recently become feasible. In Neurosurgery, medical robots have been applied to neurosurgery for over 19 years. Nevertheless this field remains unknown to most neurosurgeons. The intrinsic characteristics of robots, such as high precision, repeatability and endurance make them ideal surgeon's assistants. Unfortunately, limitations in the current available systems make its use limited to very few centers in the world. During the last decade, important efforts have been made between academic and industry partnerships to develop robots suitable for use in the operating room environment. Although some applications have been successful in areas of laparoscopic surgery and orthopaedics, Neurosurgery has presented a major challenge due to the eloquence of the surrounding anatomy. This review focuses on the application of medical robotics in neurosurgery. The paper begins with an overview of the development of the medical robotics, followed by the current clinical applications in neurosurgery and an analysis of current limitations. We discuss robotic applications based in our own experience in the field. Next, we discuss the technological challenges and research areas to overcome those limitations, including some of our current research approaches for future progress in the field.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Interventional robots currently exist for flexible ureteroscopy (fURS). However, force feedback and intra-renal pressure, which are important in fURS, were rarely considered when designing these robots.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We propose a novel robotic system for fURS integrated with partial force feedback function that is the bending knob's torque feedback of the flexible ureteroscope, and intra-renal pressure monitoring. The proposed robotic system adopts commercial haptic device to realize torque feedback. In addition, we further propose a neural network-based method to optimize the operation of above haptic device.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Experimental results show that the slave robot can capture the variation of bending conditions and feedback to the operator, and can also accurately monitor the intra-renal pressure. Besides, the neural network-based method shows its potential in improving the operation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results confirm the feasibility of proposed robot's functions. In vivo experiments are needed to further evaluate this system in future work.",0
"After Deep Learning (DL) regained popularity recently, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) field is undergoing rapid growth concerning research and real-world application development. Deep Learning has generated complexities in algorithms, and researchers and users have raised concerns regarding the usability and adoptability of Deep Learning systems. These concerns, coupled with the increasing human-AI interactions, have created the emerging field that is Human-Centered Machine Learning (HCML). We present this review paper as an overview and analysis of existing work in HCML related to DL. Firstly, we collaborated with field domain experts to develop a working definition for HCML. Secondly, through a systematic literature review, we analyze and classify 162 publications that fall within HCML. Our classification is based on aspects including contribution type, application area, and focused human categories. Finally, we analyze the topology of the HCML landscape by identifying research gaps, highlighting conflicting interpretations, addressing current challenges, and presenting future HCML research opportunities.",0
"Introduction:
        
      
      Computer vision extracts meaning from pixelated images and holds promise in automating various clinical tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a deep learning network used therein, have shown promise in analyzing X-ray images and joint photographs. We studied the performance of a CNN on standardized smartphone photographs in detecting inflammation in three hand joints and compared it to a rheumatologist's diagnosis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We enrolled 100 consecutive patients with inflammatory arthritis with an onset period of less than 2 years, excluding those with deformities. Each patient was examined by a rheumatologist, and the presence of synovitis in each joint was recorded. Hand photographs were taken in a standardized manner, anonymized, and cropped to include joints of interest. A ResNet-101 backbone modified for two class outputs (inflamed or not) was used for training. We also tested a hue-augmented dataset. We reported accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for three joints: wrist, index finger proximal interphalangeal (IFPIP), and middle finger proximal interphalangeal (MFPIP), taking the rheumatologist's opinion as the gold standard.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The cohort consisted of 100 individuals, of which 22 of them were men, with a mean age of 49.7 (SD 12.9) years. The majority of the cohort (n = 68, 68%) had rheumatoid arthritis. The wrist (125/200, 62.5%), MFPIP (94/200, 47%), and IFPIP (83/200, 41.5%) were the three most commonly inflamed joints. The CNN achieved the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting synovitis in the MFPIP (83, 77, and 88%, respectively), followed by the IFPIP (74, 74, and 75%, respectively) and the wrist (62, 90, and 21%, respectively).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      We have demonstrated that computer vision was able to detect inflammation in three joints of the hand with reasonable accuracy on standardized photographs despite a small dataset. Feature engineering was not required, and the CNN worked despite a diversity in clinical diagnosis. Larger datasets are likely to improve accuracy and help explain the basis of classification. These data suggest a potential use of computer vision in screening and follow-up of inflammatory arthritis.",0
"Focused ion beam (FIB) milling is an important rapid prototyping tool for micro- and nanofabrication and device and materials characterization. It allows for the manufacturing of arbitrary structures in a wide variety of materials, but establishing the process parameters for a given task is a multidimensional optimization challenge, usually addressed through time-consuming, iterative trial-and-error. Here, we show that deep learning from prior experience of manufacturing can predict the postfabrication appearance of structures manufactured by focused ion beam (FIB) milling with >96% accuracy over a range of ion beam parameters, taking account of instrument- and target-specific artifacts. With predictions taking only a few milliseconds, the methodology may be deployed in near real time to expedite optimization and improve reproducibility in FIB processing.",0
"The growing amount and availability of electronic health record (EHR) data present enhanced opportunities for discovering new knowledge about diseases. In the past decade, there has been an increasing number of data and text mining studies focused on the identification of disease associations (e.g., disease-disease, disease-drug, and disease-gene) in structured and unstructured EHR data. This chapter presents a knowledge discovery framework for mining the EHR for disease knowledge and describes each step for data selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and interpretation/validation. Topics including natural language processing, standards, and data privacy and security are also discussed in the context of this framework.",0
"While deep learning algorithms have advanced to a great extent, they are all designed for frame-based imagers that capture images at a high frame rate, which leads to a high storage requirement, heavy computations, and very high power consumption. Unlike frame-based imagers, event-based imagers output asynchronous pixel events without the need for global exposure time, therefore lowering both power consumption and latency. In this paper, we propose an innovative image recognition technique that operates on image events rather than frame-based data, paving the way for a new paradigm of recognizing objects prior to image acquisition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a concept is introduced featuring not only extreme early image recognition but also reduced computational overhead, storage requirement, and power consumption. Our collected event-based dataset using CeleX imager and five public event-based datasets are used to prove this concept, and the testing metrics reflect how early the neural network (NN) detects an image before the full-frame image is captured. It is demonstrated that, on average for all the datasets, the proposed technique recognizes an image 38.7 ms before the first perfect event and 603.4 ms before the last event is received, which is a reduction of 34% and 69% of the time needed, respectively. Further, less processing is required as the image is recognized 9460 events earlier, which is 37% less than waiting for the first perfectly recognized image. An enhanced NN method is also introduced to reduce this time.",0
"The emergence of Big Data has been facilitated by technological advancements in the processing, storage, and analysis of large quantities of data. Its strength is derived from its size, ease of access, and speed of analysis, and it has enabled surgeons to investigate areas of interest that traditional research models have historically been unable to address. In the future, Big Data will likely assist in the incorporation of more advanced technologies into surgical practice, including artificial intelligence and machine learning to realize the full potential of Big Data in Surgery.",0
"Computer vision-based structural deformation monitoring techniques were studied in a large number of applications in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM). Numerous laboratory tests and short-term field applications contributed to the formation of the basic framework of computer vision deformation monitoring systems towards developing long-term stable monitoring in field environments. The major contribution of this paper was to analyze the influence mechanism of the measuring accuracy of computer vision deformation monitoring systems from two perspectives, the physical impact, and target tracking algorithm impact, and provide the existing solutions. Physical impact included the hardware impact and the environmental impact, while the target tracking algorithm impact included image preprocessing, measurement efficiency and accuracy. The applicability and limitations of computer vision monitoring algorithms were summarized.",0
"Due to the influence and limitations of the multisourced, heterogeneous, and unbalanced characteristics of embedded multifunctional data, the application effect of the current data mining technology is not good, and the accuracy is low. To solve the above problems, an embedded multifunctional data mining technology based on granular computing was studied. According to the three characteristics of embedded multifunctional data, preprocessing such as data reduction, data standardization, and data balance were implemented. We implemented data granulation for the preprocessed data and calculated the data granulation characteristics, including offset, particle density, and intraparticle interval. Taking granular features as the input content, embedded multifunctional data mining was realized by using a neural network to complete the objectives of data classification, anomaly detection, fault identification, and so on. The experimental results showed that the anomaly mining results of each type of data mining were greater than 0.9, indicating that the accuracy of the mining technology is high.",0
"In an increasingly data-driven world, artificial intelligence is expected to be a key tool for converting big data into tangible benefits and the healthcare domain is no exception to this. Machine learning aims to identify complex patterns in multi-dimensional data and use these uncovered patterns to classify new unseen cases or make data-driven predictions. In recent years, deep neural networks have shown to be capable of producing results that considerably exceed those of conventional machine learning methods for various classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we provide an accessible tutorial of the most important supervised machine learning concepts and methods, including deep learning, which are potentially the most relevant for the medical domain. We aim to take some of the mystery out of machine learning and depict how machine learning models can be useful for medical applications. Finally, this tutorial provides a few practical suggestions for how to properly design a machine learning model for a generic medical problem.",0
"The sustainability of the earth depends on renewable energy. Forecasting the output of renewable energy has a big impact on how we operate and manage our power networks. Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is crucial to ensuring grid dependability and permanence and reducing the risk and cost of the energy market and infrastructure. Although there are several approaches to forecasting solar radiation on a global scale, the two most common ones are machine learning algorithms and cloud pictures combined with physical models. The objective is to present a summary of machine learning-based techniques for solar irradiation forecasting in this context. Renewable energy is being used more and more in the world's energy grid. Numerous strategies, including hybrids, physical models, statistical approaches, and artificial intelligence techniques, have been developed to anticipate the use of renewable energy. This paper examines methods for forecasting renewable energy based on deep learning and machine learning. Review and analysis of deep learning and machine learning forecasts for renewable energy come first. The second paragraph describes metaheuristic optimization techniques for renewable energy. The third topic was the open issue of projecting renewable energy. I will wrap up with a few potential future job objectives.",0
"Although computer vision syndromes are becoming a major public health concern, less emphasis is given to them, particularly in developing countries. There are primary studies on different continents; however, there are inconsistent findings in prevalence among the primary studies. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of computer vision syndrome. In this study, the review was developed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Online electronic databases, including PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, and Google Scholar, were used to retrieve published and unpublished studies. The study was conducted from December 1 to April 9/2022. Study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were performed independently by two authors. Quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument tool. Heterogeneity was assessed using the statistical test I2. STATA 14 software was used for statistical analysis. A total of 7,35 studies were retrieved, and 45 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of computer vision syndrome was 66% (95% CI: 59, 74). Subgroup analysis based on country was highest in Pakistan (97%, 95% CI: 96, 98) and lowest in Japan (12%, 95% CI: 9, 15). Subgroup analysis based on country showed that studies in Saudi Arabia (I2 = 99.41%, p value < 0.001), Ethiopia (I2 = 72.6%, p value < 0.001), and India (I2 = 98.04%, p value < 0.001) had significant heterogeneity. In the sensitivity analysis, no single study unduly influenced the overall effect estimate. Nearly two in three participants had computer vision syndrome. Thus, preventive practice strategic activities for computer vision syndrome are important interventions.",0
"AI applications play an increasingly important role in all areas of healthcare. Therefore, a basic understanding of AI technology for health professionals seems necessary. However, to date there is no learning programme in Germany that includes technological basics, applications, and perspectives of AI in healthcare for interdisciplinary health professions. The ai4health project investigates which basic knowledge and competences health professionals need to acquire for an informed handling of AI applications in healthcare, and what the appropriate didactic approach is. Through the qualitative research by interviews and a workshop, six relevant areas of competences were identified. The two most important areas are ELSA and relevant AI applications. Explainability was also highlighted as an important point. The implementation of the topics in a blended learning course for interdisciplinary health professionals and educators in the healthcare sector is now planned.",0
"Drug designing and development is an important area of research for pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists. However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost impose a hurdle and challenges that impact drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind. The primary concern associated with drug design and development is time consumption and production cost. Further, inefficiency, inaccurate target delivery, and inappropriate dosage are other hurdles that inhibit the process of drug delivery and development. With advancements in technology, computer-aided drug design integrating artificial intelligence algorithms can eliminate the challenges and hurdles of traditional drug design and development. Artificial intelligence is referred to as superset comprising machine learning, whereas machine learning comprises supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Further, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been extensively implemented in drug design and development. The artificial neural network, deep neural network, support vector machines, classification and regression, generative adversarial networks, symbolic learning, and meta-learning are examples of the algorithms applied to the drug design and discovery process. Artificial intelligence has been applied to different areas of drug design and development process, such as from peptide synthesis to molecule design, virtual screening to molecular docking, quantitative structure-activity relationship to drug repositioning, protein misfolding to protein-protein interactions, and molecular pathway identification to polypharmacology. Artificial intelligence principles have been applied to the classification of active and inactive, monitoring drug release, pre-clinical and clinical development, primary and secondary drug screening, biomarker development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bioactivity identification and physiochemical properties, prediction of toxicity, and identification of mode of action.",0
"As the adoption of robotic-assisted procedures expands across various surgical specialties, colorectal surgery stands out as a prominent beneficiary. This rise in usage can be traced back to the increased accessibility of robotic platforms and a growing institutional shift towards cutting-edge surgical methods. When compared with traditional laparoscopic methods, robotic techniques offer distinct advantages. Their true potential shines in surgeries involving complex anatomical regions, where the robot's enhanced dexterity and range of motion prove invaluable. The three-dimensional, magnified view provided by robotic systems further boosts surgical precision and clarity. These advantages render robotic assistance especially suitable for colorectal surgeries, notably in intricate areas such as the rectum and endoluminal spaces. As the medical world emphasizes minimally invasive surgical methods, there's a pressing need to evolve and optimize robotic techniques in colorectal surgery. This article traces the evolution of robotic interventions in colorectal surgeries, highlighting both its historical milestones and anticipated future trends. We'll also explore emerging robotic tools and systems set to reshape the colorectal surgical arena.",0
"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of telemedicine has grown exponentially over the past decade, along with the adoption of AI-based telemedicine to support public health systems. Although AI-based telemedicine can open up novel opportunities for the delivery of clinical health and care and become a strong aid to public health systems worldwide, it also comes with ethical risks that should be detected, prevented, or mitigated for the responsible use of AI-based telemedicine in and for public health. However, despite the current proliferation of AI ethics frameworks, thus far, none have been developed for the design of AI-based telemedicine, especially for the adoption of AI-based telemedicine in and for public health. We aimed to fill this gap by mapping the most relevant AI ethics principles for AI-based telemedicine for public health and by showing the need to revise them via major ethical themes emerging from bioethics, medical ethics, and public health ethics toward the definition of a unified set of 6 AI ethics principles for the implementation of AI-based telemedicine.

"Image segmentation and computer vision are becoming more important in computer-aided design. A computer algorithm extracts image borders, colours, and textures. It also depletes resources. Technical knowledge is required to extract information about distinctive features. There is currently no medical picture segmentation or recognition software available. The proposed model has 13 layers and uses dilated convolution and max-pooling to extract small features. Ghost model deletes the duplicated features, makes the process easier, and reduces the complexity. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) generates a feature vector map and improves the accuracy of area or bounding box proposals. Restructuring is required for healing. As a result, convolutional neural networks segment medical images. It is possible to acquire the beginning region of a segmented medical image. The proposed model gives better results as compared to the traditional models, it gives an accuracy of 96.05, Precision 98.2, and recall 95.78. The first findings are improved by thickening and categorising the image's pixels. Morphological techniques may be used to segment medical images. Experiments demonstrate that the recommended segmentation strategy is effective. This study rethinks medical image segmentation methods.",0
"Cytology is a low-cost and non-invasive diagnostic procedure employed to support the diagnosis of a broad range of pathologies. Cells are harvested from tissues by aspiration or scraping, and it is still predominantly performed manually by medical or laboratory professionals extensively trained for this purpose. It is a time-consuming and repetitive process where many diagnostic criteria are subjective and vulnerable to human interpretation. Computer Vision technologies, by automatically generating quantitative and objective descriptions of examinations' contents, can help minimize the chances of misdiagnoses and shorten the time required for analysis. To identify the state-of-art of computer vision techniques currently applied to cytology, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review, searching for approaches for the segmentation, detection, quantification, and classification of cells and organelles using computer vision on cytology slides. We analyzed papers published in the last 4 years. The initial search was executed in September 2020 and resulted in 431 articles. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 157 papers remained, which we analyzed to build a picture of the tendencies and problems present in this research area, highlighting the computer vision methods, staining techniques, evaluation metrics, and the availability of the used datasets and computer code. As a result, we identified that the most used methods in the analyzed works are deep learning-based (70 papers), while fewer works employ classic computer vision only (101 papers). The most recurrent metric used for classification and object detection was the accuracy (33 papers and 5 papers), while for segmentation it was the Dice Similarity Coefficient (38 papers). Regarding staining techniques, Papanicolaou was the most employed one (130 papers), followed by H&E (20 papers) and Feulgen (5 papers). Twelve of the datasets used in the papers are publicly available, with the DTU/Herlev dataset being the most used one. We conclude that there still is a lack of high-quality datasets for many types of stains and most of the works are not mature enough to be applied in a daily clinical diagnostic routine. We also identified a growing tendency towards adopting deep learning-based approaches as the methods of choice.",0
"Pneumatically-actuated soft robots have advantages over traditional rigid robots in many applications. In particular, their flexible bodies and gentle air-powered movements make them more suitable for use around humans and other objects that could be injured or damaged by traditional robots. However, existing systems for controlling soft robots currently require dedicated electromechanical hardware (usually solenoid valves) to maintain the actuation state (expanded or contracted) of each independent actuator. When combined with power, computation, and sensing components, this control hardware adds considerable cost, size, and power demands to the robot, thereby limiting the feasibility of soft robots in many important application areas. In this work, we introduce a pneumatic memory that uses air (not electricity) to set and maintain the states of large numbers of soft robotic actuators without dedicated electromechanical hardware. These pneumatic logic circuits use normally-closed microfluidic valves as transistor-like elements; this enables our circuits to support more complex computational functions than those built from normally-open valves. We demonstrate an eight-bit nonvolatile random-access pneumatic memory (RAM) that can maintain the states of multiple actuators, control both individual actuators and multiple actuators simultaneously using a pneumatic version of time division multiplexing (TDM), and set actuators to any intermediate position using a pneumatic version of analog-to-digital conversion. We perform proof-of-concept experimental testing of our pneumatic RAM by using it to control soft robotic hands playing individual notes, chords, and songs on a piano keyboard. By dramatically reducing the amount of hardware required to control multiple independent actuators in pneumatic soft robots, our pneumatic RAM can accelerate the spread of soft robotic technologies to a wide range of important application areas.",0
"The aim of this study was to design a new deep learning framework for end-to-end processing of polysomnograms. This framework can be trained to analyze whole-night polysomnograms without the limitations of and bias towards clinical scoring guidelines. We validated the framework by predicting the age of subjects. We designed a hierarchical attention network architecture, which can be pre-trained to predict labels based on 5-minute epochs of data and fine-tuned to predict based on whole-night polysomnography recordings. The model was trained on 511 recordings from the Cleveland Family study and tested on 146 test subjects aged between 6 to 88 years. The proposed network achieved a mean absolute error of 7.36 years and a correlation to true age of 0.857. Sleep can be analyzed using our end-to-end deep learning framework, which we expect can generalize to learning other subject-specific labels such as sleep disorders. The difference in the predicted and chronological age is further proposed as an estimate of biological age.",0
"Background:
        
      
      As surgical robots begin to occupy a larger place in operating rooms around the world, continued innovation is necessary to improve our outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive review of current surgical robotic user interfaces was performed to describe the modern surgical platforms, identify the benefits, and address the issues of feedback and limitations of visualization.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Most robots currently used in surgery employ a master/slave relationship, with the surgeon seated at a work-console, manipulating the master system and visualizing the operation on a video screen. Although enormous strides have been made to advance current technology to the point of clinical use, limitations still exist. A lack of haptic feedback to the surgeon and the inability of the surgeon to be stationed at the operating table are the most notable examples. The future of robotic surgery sees a marked increase in the visualization technologies used in the operating room, as well as in the robots' abilities to convey haptic feedback to the surgeon. This will allow unparalleled sensation for the surgeon and almost eliminate inadvertent tissue contact and injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A novel design for a user interface will allow the surgeon to have access to the patient bedside, remaining sterile throughout the procedure, employ a head-mounted three-dimensional visualization system, and allow the most intuitive master manipulation of the slave robot to date.",0
"We analyze deep neural networks using the theory of Riemannian geometry and curvature. The objective is to gain insight into how Riemannian geometry can characterize and predict the trained behavior of neural networks. We define a method for calculating Riemann and Ricci curvature tensors, and Ricci scalar curvature values for a trained neural net, in such a way that the output classifier softmax values are related to the input transformations, through the curvature equations. We also measure these curvature tensors experimentally for different networks which are pretrained with stochastic gradient descent and offer a way of visualizing and understanding the measurements to gain insight into the effect curvature has on behavior the neural networks locally, and possibly predict their behavior for different transformations of the test data. We also analyze the effect of variation in depth of the neural networks as well as how it behaves for different choices of data set.",0
"Mobile robots perform fetch-and-carry tasks autonomously. An intelligent, sensor-equipped mobile robot does not require dedicated pathways or extensive facility modification. In the hospital, mobile robots can be used to carry specimens, pharmaceuticals, meals, etc. between supply centers, patient areas, and laboratories. The HelpMate (Transitions Research Corp.) mobile robot was developed specifically for hospital environments. To reach a desired destination, Help-Mate navigates with an on-board computer that continuously polls a suite of sensors, matches the sensor data against a pre-programmed map of the environment, and issues drive commands and path corrections. A sender operates the robot with a user-friendly menu that prompts for payload insertion and desired destination(s). Upon arrival at its selected destination, the robot prompts the recipient for a security code or physical key and awaits acknowledgement of payload removal. In the future, the integration of HelpMate with robot manipulators, test equipment, and central institutional information systems will open new applications in more localized areas and should help overcome difficulties in filling transport staff positions.",0
"Significant progress has been made in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical medicine over the past decade, but the clinical development of AI faces challenges. Although the spectrum of AI applications is growing within clinical medicine, including in subspecialty neurosurgery, applications focused on cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are relatively scarce. The recently introduced brainstem cavernous malformation (BSCM) grading scale, approach triangles, and safe entry zone systems provide a discrete framework to explore future machine learning (ML) applications of AI systems. Given the immense scalability of these models, significant resources will likely be allocated to pursuing these future efforts.",0
"Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision utilizing the increased availability of big data and the power of parallel computational units such as graphical processing units. The vast majority of deep learning research is conducted using images as training data, however the biomedical domain is rich in physiological signals that are used for diagnosis and prediction problems. It is still an open research question how to best utilize signals to train deep neural networks.In this paper we define the term Signal2Image (S2Is) as trainable or non-trainable prefix modules that convert signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG), to image-like representations making them suitable for training image-based deep neural networks defined as `base models'. We compare the accuracy and time performance of four S2Is (`signal as image', spectrogram, one and two layer Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)) combined with a set of `base models' (LeNet, AlexNet, VGGnet, ResNet, DenseNet) along with the depth-wise and 1D variations of the latter. We also provide empirical evidence that the one layer CNN S2I performs better in eleven out of fifteen tested models than non-trainable S2Is for classifying EEG signals and present visual comparisons of the outputs of some of the S2Is.",0
"The functionalities of the untethered miniature swimming robots significantly decrease as the robot size becomes smaller, due to limitations of feasible miniaturized on-board components. Here we propose an untethered jellyfish-inspired soft millirobot that could realize multiple functionalities in moderate Reynolds number by producing diverse controlled fluidic flows around its body using its magnetic composite elastomer lappets, which are actuated by an external oscillating magnetic field. We particularly investigate the interaction between the robot's soft body and incurred fluidic flows due to the robot's body motion, and utilize such physical interaction to achieve different predation-inspired object manipulation tasks. The proposed lappet kinematics can inspire other existing jellyfish-like robots to achieve similar functionalities at the same length and time scale. Moreover, the robotic platform could be used to study the impacts of the morphology and kinematics changing in ephyra jellyfish.",0
"Earthworms are fascinating animals capable of crawling and burrowing through various terrains using peristaltic motion and the directional friction response of their epidermis. Anisotropic anchoring governed by tiny appendages on their skin called setae is known to enhance the earthworm's locomotion. A multi-material fabrication technique is employed to produce soft skins with bristles inspired by the earthworm epidermis and their setae. The effect of bristles arranged in triangular and square grids at two spatial densities on the locomotion capability of a simple soft crawling robot comprised of an extending soft actuator covered by the soft skin is investigated experimentally. The results suggest that the presence of bristles results in a rostral to caudal friction ratio of µR/µC > 1 with some variations across bristle arrangements and applied elongations. Doubling the number of bristles increases the robot's speed by a factor of 1.78 for the triangular grid while it is less pronounced for the rectangular grid with a small factor of 1.06. Additionally, it is observed that increasing the actuation stroke for the skin with the high-density triangular grid, from 15% to 30%, elevates the speed from 0.5 to 0.9 mm s-1, but further increases in stroke to 45% may compromise the durability of the actuators with less gains in speed (1 mm s-1). Finally, it is demonstrated that a crawling robot equipped with soft skin can traverse both a linear and a curved channel.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly finding its way into medicine, and it is not yet clear how it will change the practice of medicine and the way doctors see themselves. This article explores the ethical limits of AI by (1) discussing the reductionistic elements inherent in AI, (2) working out the problematic implications of algorithmisation and (3) highlighting the lack of human control as an ethical problem of AI. The conclusion is that although AI is a useful tool to support medical judgement, it is absolutely dependent on human decision-making authority in order to actually prove beneficial for medicine.",0
"The confocal-line (CL) technique combines some of the characteristics of confocal-scanning microscopy with those of conventional-imaging methods. It is based on the introduction of line-shaped illumination and linear image detection, as an alternative to the current confocal-point (CP) approach. Although confocal only in one dimension, the proposed solution offers performance and features adequate to a variety of biological and non-biological applications and is also adaptable to an increased number of microscopical observations and measurements. The absence of moving components in the optical path and the use of electronic linear imagers permits flexible and fast operation that appears particularly relevant in many fields of basic and applied research. For instance, transmission, reflection and emission images can simultaneously be collected from the same area of the specimen, with slight adjustments to the optical setup. Useful extensions of CL microscopy to the field of spectral imaging are obtained with the introduction of a slit, a polychromator and an area detector, substituting for the linear imager. Prototype instrumentation has been constructed working from the cited principles and some tests have been performed on selected applications.",0
"Food safety is one of the main challenges of the agri-food industry that is expected to be addressed in the current environment of tremendous technological progress, where consumers' lifestyles and preferences are in a constant state of flux. Food chain transparency and trust are drivers for food integrity control and for improvements in efficiency and economic growth. Similarly, the circular economy has great potential to reduce wastage and improve the efficiency of operations in multi-stakeholder ecosystems. Throughout the food chain cycle, all food commodities are exposed to multiple hazards, resulting in a high likelihood of contamination. Such biological or chemical hazards may be naturally present at any stage of food production, whether accidentally introduced or fraudulently imposed, risking consumers' health and their faith in the food industry. Nowadays, a massive amount of data is generated, not only from the next generation of food safety monitoring systems and along the entire food chain (primary production included) but also from the Internet of things, media, and other devices. These data should be used for the benefit of society, and the scientific field of data science should be a vital player in helping to make this possible.",0
"Artificial intelligence technologies such as computer vision (CV), machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics have advanced rapidly in recent years.

This paper summarizes the specific applications of non-contact measurement based on infrared images and visible images in the areas of personnel skin temperature, position posture, the urban physical environment, building construction safety, and equipment operation status. At the same time, the challenges and opportunities associated with the application of CV technology are anticipated.",0

"The role of computer vision in extracting radiographic (radiomics) and histopathologic (pathognomics) features is an extension of molecular biomarkers that have been foundational to our understanding across the spectrum of head and neck disorders. Especially within head and neck cancers, machine learning and deep learning applications have yielded advances in the characterization of tumor features, nodal features, and various outcomes. This review aims to overview the landscape of radiomic and pathognomic applications, informing future work to address gaps. Novel methodologies will be needed to potentially engineer ways of integrating multidimensional data inputs to examine disease features to guide prognosis comprehensively and ultimately clinical management.",0
"A series of recent studies from our laboratory have added to the preceding literature on the potential role of water (in addition to food) as a positive reinforcer in the schedule-induced drinking situation, thus suggesting that adjunctive behaviors might have motivational properties that make their engagement a preferable alternative. It has also been suggested that adjunctive behaviors serve as a behavioral clock that helps organisms to estimate time, making their engagement motivational, so that they enable more accurate time adjustment under temporal schedules. Here, we review some of these experiments on conditioned reinforcement and concurrent chains, as well as on temporal learning. Data presented in this article suggest that adjunctive behaviors may be a part of the behavior patterns maintained by reinforcement, thus serving towards a better performance in temporal tasks.",0
"Significant efforts are being made to develop artificial intelligence technologies for health settings. In a health system that has been notoriously slow to adopt innovative technologies, it is important to consider the implementation of a new technology early in the development stage, especially one that will have added challenges of trust and transparency. To facilitate this process, an implementation framework for artificial intelligence technologies in clinical settings has been created.",0
"The ability to predict, anticipate and reason about future outcomes is a key component of intelligent decision-making systems. In light of the success of deep learning in computer vision, deep-learning-based video prediction emerged as a promising research direction. Defined as a self-supervised learning task, video prediction represents a suitable framework for representation learning, as it demonstrated potential capabilities for extracting meaningful representations of the underlying patterns in natural videos. Motivated by the increasing interest in this task, we provide a review on the deep learning methods for prediction in video sequences. We first define the video prediction fundamentals, as well as mandatory background concepts and the most used datasets. Next, we carefully analyze existing video prediction models organized according to a proposed taxonomy, highlighting their contributions and their significance in the field. The summary of the datasets and methods is accompanied with experimental results that facilitate the assessment of the state of the art on a quantitative basis. The paper is summarized by drawing some general conclusions, identifying open research challenges and by pointing out future research directions.",0
"Objective.Supervised deep learning for image super-resolution (SR) has limitations in biomedical imaging due to the lack of large amounts of low- and high-resolution image pairs for model training. In this work, we propose a reference-free statistical implicit neural representation (INR) framework, which needs only a single or a few observed low-resolution (LR) image(s), to generate high-quality SR images.Approach.The framework models the statistics of the observed LR images via maximum likelihood estimation and trains the INR network to represent the latent high-resolution (HR) image as a continuous function in the spatial domain. The INR network is constructed as a coordinate-based multi-layer perceptron, whose inputs are image spatial coordinates and outputs are corresponding pixel intensities. The trained INR not only constrains functional smoothness but also allows an arbitrary scale in SR imaging.Main results.We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework on various biomedical images, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorescence microscopy, and ultrasound images, across different SR magnification scales of 2×, 4×, and 8×. A limited number of LR images were used for each of the SR imaging tasks to show the potential of the proposed statistical INR framework.Significance.The proposed method provides an urgently needed unsupervised deep learning framework for numerous biomedical SR applications that lack HR reference images.",0
"Importance:
        
      
      Since the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, generative artificial intelligence (genAI) has elicited enormous enthusiasm and serious concerns.
    


          Observations:
        
      
      History has shown that general purpose technologies often fail to deliver their promised benefits for many years (""the productivity paradox of information technology""). Health care has several attributes that make the successful deployment of new technologies even more difficult than in other industries; these have challenged prior efforts to implement AI and electronic health records. However, genAI has unique properties that may shorten the usual lag between implementation and productivity and/or quality gains in health care. Moreover, the health care ecosystem has evolved to make it more receptive to genAI, and many health care organizations are poised to implement the complementary innovations in culture, leadership, workforce, and workflow often needed for digital innovations to flourish.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      The ability of genAI to rapidly improve and the capacity of organizations to implement complementary innovations that allow IT tools to reach their potential are more advanced than in the past; thus, genAI is capable of delivering meaningful improvements in health care more rapidly than was the case with previous technologies.",0
"Machine learning (ML) refers to a set of automatic pattern recognition methods that have been successfully applied across various problem domains, including biomedical image analysis. This review focuses on ML applications for image analysis in light microscopy experiments with typical tasks of segmenting and tracking individual cells, and modelling of reconstructed lineage trees. After describing a typical image analysis pipeline and highlighting challenges of automatic analysis (for example, variability in cell morphology, tracking in presence of clutters) this review gives a brief historical outlook of ML, followed by basic concepts and definitions required for understanding examples. This article then presents several example applications at various image processing stages, including the use of supervised learning methods for improving cell segmentation, and the application of active learning for tracking. The review concludes with remarks on parameter setting and future directions.",0
"The acquisition of instrumental responding can be supported by primary reinforcers or by conditional (also known as secondary) reinforcers that themselves have an association to a primary reinforcer. While primary reinforcement has been heavily studied for the past century, the associative basis of conditioned reinforcement has received comparatively little experimental examination. Yet conditioned reinforcement has been employed as an important behavioral assay in neuroscience studies, and thus an analysis of its associative basis is called for. We evaluated the extent to which an element from a previously trained compound would facilitate conditioned reinforcement. Three groups of rats received Pavlovian conditioning with a visual-auditory compound cue followed by food. After training, a lever was made available that, when pressed, produced the same trained compound (group compound), only the auditory cue (group element), or a novel auditory cue (group control). The rats in group compound pressed the lever at a higher rate than did rats in either group element or group control, demonstrating a strong conditioned reinforcement effect only in group compound. Interestingly, there was almost no difference in responding between group element and group control. The implications of this generalization decrement in conditioned reinforcement are discussed-particularly as they relate to research in behavioral neuroscience.

"How does the similarity between stimuli affect our ability to learn appropriate response associations for them? In typical laboratory experiments learning is investigated under somewhat ideal circumstances, where stimuli are easily discriminable. This is not representative of most real-life learning, where overlapping ""stimuli"" can result in different ""rewards"" and may be learned simultaneously (e.g., you may learn over repeated interactions that a specific dog is friendly, but that a very similar looking one isn't). With two experiments, we test how humans learn in three stimulus conditions: one ""best case"" condition in which stimuli have idealized and highly discriminable visual and semantic representations, and two in which stimuli have overlapping representations, making them less discriminable. We find that, unsurprisingly, decreasing stimuli discriminability decreases performance. We develop computational models to test different hypotheses about how reinforcement learning (RL) and working memory (WM) processes are affected by different stimulus conditions. Our results replicate earlier studies demonstrating the importance of both processes to capture behavior. However, our results extend previous studies by demonstrating that RL, and not WM, is affected by stimulus distinctness: people learn slower and have higher across-stimulus value confusion at decision when stimuli are more similar to each other. These results illustrate strong effects of stimulus type on learning and demonstrate the importance of considering parallel contributions of different cognitive processes when studying behavior.",0
"The ability to detect patterns and trends across protocol deviations (PDs) is key to ensure high data quality and sufficient oversight of patient safety. In clinical trial operations, some business processes and work instructions limit efficient protocol deviation trending because a majority of protocol deviations are left unclassified. When this occurs, it restricts clinical teams from determining systemic issues or signals in the data. The unstructured text in protocol deviation descriptions is an important component of trial operation knowledge. Natural language processing (NLP) can make protocol deviation descriptions more accessible and can support information extraction and trending analysis. This paper reviews how the natural language processing techniques of Term-Frequency Inverse-Document-Frequency (TF-IDF) combined with the supervised machine learning model of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and word embedding approaches such as word2vec can be used to categorize/label protocol deviations across multiple therapeutic areas. NLP is a key tool that will lead to more data driven decisions in clinical trial operations.",0
"Many commercial actors in the tech sector publish ethics guidelines as a means to 'wash away' concerns raised about their policies. For some academics, this phenomenon is reason to replace ethics with other tools and methods in an attempt to make sure that the tech sector does not cross any moral Rubicons. Others warn against the tendency to reduce a criticism of 'ethics washing' into one of ethics simpliciter. In this essay, I argue firstly that the dominant focus on principles, dilemmas, and theory in conventional ethical theories and practices could be an explanation of it lacking resistance to abuse by dominant actors, and hence its rather disappointing capacity to stop, redirect, or at least slow down big tech's course. Secondly, drawing from research on casuistry and political philosopher Raymond Geuss, this essay will make a case for a question, rather than theory or principle-based ethical data practice. The emphasis of this approach is placed on the acquisition of a thorough understanding of a social-political phenomenon like tech development. This approach should be replenished with one extra component to the picture of the repoliticized data ethics drawn so far: the importance of 'exemplars,' or stories. Precisely the fact that one should acquire an in-depth understanding of the problem in practice will also allow one to look in the past, present, or future for similar and comparable stories from which one can learn.",0
"The partial reinforcement extinction effect (PREE) refers to the phenomenon that conditioned responding extinguishes more slowly if subjects had been inconsistently (""partially"") reinforced than if they had been reinforced on every trial (""continuously"" reinforced). One largely successful account of the PREE, known as sequential theory (Capaldi, 1966), suggests that, when subjects are partially reinforced, they learn that memories of sequences of nonreinforced trials are associated with subsequent reinforcement. This association helps to maintain responding (i.e., delay extinction) when the subjects experience nonreinforced trials during extinction. Sequential theory's explanation of the PREE hinges on subjects learning sequences of nonreinforced trials during acquisition. However, direct evidence for such sequential learning is not available in previous studies of the PREE where animals are trained with multiple sequences of different lengths that are randomly intermixed and, therefore, cannot anticipate whether a given trial will be reinforced during acquisition. The current study conducted two experiments that trained rats with a single fixed trial sequence to provide evidence of sequential learning during conditioning, and then observe its effect on the PREE. Under one condition the rats did learn about the fixed sequence but did not subsequently show a PREE, whereas other rats that did show a PREE had not learned the trial sequences during conditioning. Therefore, contrary to sequential theory's prediction, our result suggests that learning about the trial sequence is neither necessary nor sufficient for the PREE. We suggest that the PREE may instead depend on uncertainty about whether the conditioned stimulus will be reinforced. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).",0
"Objectives:
        
      
      Owing to the rapid progress of natural language processing (NLP), the role of NLP in the medical field has radically gained considerable attention from both NLP and medical informatics. Although numerous medical NLP papers are published annually, there is still a gap between basic NLP research and practical product development. This gap raises questions, such as what has medical NLP achieved in each medical field, and what is the burden for the practical use of NLP? This paper aims to clarify the above questions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We explore the literature on potential NLP products/services applied to various medical/clinical/healthcare areas.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This paper introduces clinical applications (bedside applications), in which we introduce the use of NLP for each clinical department, internal medicine, pre-surgery, post-surgery, oncology, radiology, pathology, psychiatry, rehabilitation, obstetrics, and gynecology. Also, we clarify technical problems to be addressed for encouraging bedside applications based on NLP.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results contribute to discussions regarding potentially feasible NLP applications and highlight research gaps for future studies.",0
"Critics currently argue that applied ethics approaches to artificial intelligence (AI) are too principles-oriented and entail a theory-practice gap. Several applied ethical approaches try to prevent such a gap by conceptually translating ethical theory into practice. In this article, we explore how the currently most prominent approaches of AI ethics translate ethics into practice. Therefore, we examine three approaches to applied AI ethics: the embedded ethics approach, the ethically aligned approach, and the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach. We analyze each of these three approaches by asking how they understand and conceptualize theory and practice. We outline the conceptual strengths as well as their shortcomings: an embedded ethics approach is context-oriented but risks being biased by it; ethically aligned approaches are principles-oriented but lack justification theories to deal with trade-offs between competing principles; and the interdisciplinary Value Sensitive Design approach is based on stakeholder values but needs linkage to political, legal, or social governance aspects. Against this background, we develop a meta-framework for applied AI ethics conceptions with three dimensions. Based on critical theory, we suggest these dimensions as starting points to critically reflect on the conceptualization of theory and practice. We claim, first, that the inclusion of the dimension of affects and emotions in the ethical decision-making process stimulates reflections on vulnerabilities, experiences of disregard, and marginalization already within the AI development process. Second, we derive from our analysis that considering the dimension of justifying normative background theories provides both standards and criteria as well as guidance for prioritizing or evaluating competing principles in cases of conflict. Third, we argue that reflecting the governance dimension in ethical decision-making is an important factor to reveal power structures as well as to realize ethical AI and its application because this dimension seeks to combine social, legal, technical, and political concerns. This meta-framework can thus serve as a reflective tool for understanding, mapping, and assessing the theory-practice conceptualizations within AI ethics approaches to address and overcome their blind spots.",0
"Sexual reinforcers are not part of a regulatory system involved in the maintenance of critical metabolic processes, they differ for males and females, they differ as a function of species and mating system, and they show ontogenetic and seasonal changes related to endocrine conditions. Exposure to a member of the opposite sex without copulation can be sufficient for sexual reinforcement. However, copulatory access is a stronger reinforcer, and copulatory opportunity can serve to enhance the reinforcing efficacy of stimulus features of a sexual partner. Conversely, under certain conditions, noncopulatory exposure serves to decrease reinforcer efficacy. Many common learning phenomena such as acquisition, extinction, discrimination learning, second-order conditioning, and latent inhibition have been demonstrated in sexual conditioning. These observations extend the generality of findings obtained with more conventional reinforcers, but the mechanisms of these effects and their gender and species specificity remain to be explored.",0
"Elasticity has been linked to the remarkable propulsive efficiency of pulse-jet animals such as the squid and jellyfish, but reports that quantify the underlying dynamics or demonstrate its application in robotic systems are rare. This work identifies the pulse-jet propulsion mode used by these animals as a coupled mass-spring-mass oscillator, enabling the design of a flexible self-propelled robot. We use this system to experimentally demonstrate that resonance greatly benefits pulse-jet swimming speed and efficiency, and the robot's optimal cost of transport is found to match that of the most efficient biological swimmers in nature, such as the jellyfish Aurelia aurita The robot also exhibits a preferred Strouhal number for efficient swimming, thereby bridging the gap between pulse-jet propulsion and established findings in efficient fish swimming. Extensions of the current robotic framework to larger amplitude oscillations could combine resonance effects with optimal vortex formation to further increase propulsive performance and potentially outperform biological swimmers altogether.",0
"Background:
        
      
      The performance of machine learning classification methods relies heavily on the choice of features. In many domains, feature generation can be labor-intensive and require domain knowledge, and feature selection methods do not scale well in high-dimensional datasets. Deep learning has shown success in feature generation but requires large datasets to achieve high classification accuracy. Biology domains typically exhibit these challenges with numerous handcrafted features (high-dimensional) and small amounts of training data (low volume).
    


          Method:
        
      
      A hybrid learning approach is proposed that first trains a deep network on the training data, extracts features from the deep network, and then uses these features to re-express the data for input to a non-deep learning method, which is trained to perform the final classification.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The approach is systematically evaluated to determine the best layer of the deep learning network from which to extract features and the threshold on training data volume that prefers this approach. Results from several domains show that this hybrid approach outperforms standalone deep and non-deep learning methods, especially on low-volume, high-dimensional datasets. The diverse collection of datasets further supports the robustness of the approach across different domains.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The hybrid approach combines the strengths of deep and non-deep learning paradigms to achieve high performance on high-dimensional, low volume learning tasks that are typical in biology domains.",0

"Healthcare organizations have realized that Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a competitive edge through personalized patient experiences, improved patient outcomes, early diagnosis, augmented clinician capabilities, enhanced operational efficiencies, or improved medical service accessibility. However, deploying AI-driven tools in the healthcare ecosystem could be challenging. This paper categorizes AI applications in healthcare and comprehensively examines the challenges associated with deploying AI in medical practices at scale. As AI continues to make strides in healthcare, its integration presents various challenges, including production timelines, trust generation, privacy concerns, algorithmic biases, and data scarcity. The paper highlights that flawed business models and wrong workflows in healthcare practices cannot be rectified merely by deploying AI-driven tools. Healthcare organizations should re-evaluate root problems such as misaligned financial incentives (e.g., fee-for-service models), dysfunctional medical workflows (e.g., high rates of patient readmissions), poor care coordination between different providers, fragmented electronic health records systems, and inadequate patient education and engagement models in tandem with AI adoption. This study also explores the need for a cultural shift in viewing AI not as a threat but as an enabler that can enhance healthcare delivery and create new employment opportunities while emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying operational issues. The necessity of investments beyond finance is discussed, emphasizing the importance of human capital, continuous learning, and a supportive environment for AI integration. The paper also highlights the crucial role of clear regulations in building trust, ensuring safety, and guiding the ethical use of AI, calling for coherent frameworks addressing transparency, model accuracy, data quality control, liability, and ethics. Furthermore, this paper underscores the importance of advancing AI literacy within academia to prepare future healthcare professionals for an AI-driven landscape. Through careful navigation and proactive measures addressing these challenges, the healthcare community can harness AI's transformative power responsibly and effectively, revolutionizing healthcare delivery and patient care. The paper concludes with a vision and strategic suggestions for the future of healthcare with AI, emphasizing thoughtful, responsible, and innovative engagement as the pathway to realizing its full potential to unlock immense benefits for healthcare organizations, physicians, nurses, and patients while proactively mitigating risks.",0

"In industry 4.0, where the automation and digitalization of entities and processes are fundamental, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a pivotal tool offering innovative solutions in various domains. In this context, nutrition, a critical aspect of public health, is no exception to the fields influenced by the integration of AI technology. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the current landscape of AI in nutrition, providing a deep understanding of the potential of AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in nutrition sciences and highlighting eventual challenges and futuristic directions. A hybrid approach from the systematic literature review (SLR) guidelines and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was adopted to systematically analyze the scientific literature from a search of major databases on artificial intelligence in nutrition sciences. A rigorous study selection was conducted using the most appropriate eligibility criteria, followed by a methodological quality assessment ensuring the robustness of the included studies. This review identifies several AI applications in nutrition, spanning smart and personalized nutrition, dietary assessment, food recognition and tracking, predictive modeling for disease prevention, and disease diagnosis and monitoring. The selected studies demonstrated the versatility of machine learning and deep learning techniques in handling complex relationships within nutritional datasets. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of AI applications in nutrition sciences and identifies challenges and opportunities. With the rapid advancement in AI, its integration into nutrition holds significant promise to enhance individual nutritional outcomes and optimize dietary recommendations. Researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals can utilize this research to design future projects and support evidence-based decision-making in AI for nutrition and dietary guidance.",0
"In a typical transposition task, an animal is presented with a single pair of stimuli (for example, S3+ S4-, where plus and minus denote reward and nonreward and digits denote stimulus location on a sensory dimension such as size). Subsequently, an animal is presented with a testing pair that contains a previously reinforced or nonreinforced stimulus and a novel stimulus (for example, S2-S3 and S4-S5). Does the choice of a novel S2 instead of previously reinforced S3 in a testing pair S2-S3 indicate that the animal has learned a relation (i.e., ""select smaller"")? This review of empirical evidence and theoretical accounts shows that an organism's behavior in a transposition task is undoubtedly influenced by prior reinforcement history of the training stimuli (Spence, 1937). However, it is also affected by two other factors that are relational in nature-a similarity of two testing stimuli to each other and an overall similarity of the testing pair as a whole to the training pair as a whole. The influence of the two latter factors is especially evident in studies that use multiple pairs of training stimuli and a wide range of testing pairs comprising nonadjacent stimuli (Lazareva, Miner, Young, & Wasserman, 2008; Lazareva, Wasserman, & Young, 2005). In sum, the evidence suggests that both prior reinforcement history and relational information affect an animal's behavior in a typical transposition task.",0
Cancer is a disease which is characterised by the unusual and uncontrollable growth of body cells. This usually happens asymptomatically and gets spread to other parts of the body. The major problem in treating cancer is that its progress is not monitored once it is diagnosed. The progress or the prognosis can be done through survival analysis. The survival analysis is the branch of statistics that deals in predicting the time of event of occurrence. In the case of cancer prognosis the event is the survival time of the patient from the onset of the disease or it can be the recurrence of the disease after undergoing a treatment. This study aims to bring out the machine learning and deep learning models involved in providing the prognosis to the cancer patients.,0
"The development of biologically-inspired computational models has been the focus of study ever since the artificial neuron was introduced by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943. However, a scrutiny of literature reveals that most attempts to replicate the highly efficient and complex biological visual system have been futile or have met with limited success. The recent state-of the-art computer vision models, such as pre-trained deep neural networks and vision transformers, may not be biologically inspired per se. Nevertheless, certain aspects of biological vision are still found embedded, knowingly or unknowingly, in the architecture and functioning of these models. This paper explores several principles related to visual neuroscience and the biological visual pathway that resonate, in some manner, in the architectural design and functioning of contemporary computer vision models. The findings of this survey can provide useful insights for building futuristic bio-inspired computer vision models. The survey is conducted from a historical perspective, tracing the biological connections of computer vision models starting with the basic artificial neuron to modern technologies such as deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and spiking neural networks (SNN). One spotlight of the survey is a discussion on biologically plausible neural networks and bio-inspired unsupervised learning mechanisms adapted for computer vision tasks in recent times.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with mathematical algorithms to mimic the abilities and intellectual work performed by the human brain. Nowadays, AI is being effectively utilized in addressing difficult healthcare challenges, including complex biological abnormalities, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical prognosis of various life-threatening diseases, like cancer. Deep neural networking (DNN), a subset of AI, is prominently being applied in clinical research programs on cancer.

"In the elective field of adrenal imaging, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for adrenal lesion detection, characterization, hypersecreting syndrome management and patient follow-up. Although a perfect AI tool that includes all required steps from detection to analysis does not exist yet, multiple AI algorithms have been developed and tested with encouraging results. However, AI in this setting is still at an early stage. In this regard, most published studies about AI in adrenal gland imaging report preliminary results that do not have yet daily applications in clinical practice. In this review, recent developments and current results of AI in the field of adrenal imaging are presented. Limitations and future perspectives of AI are discussed.",0

"Big data is the fuel of mankind's fourth industrial revolution. Coupled with new technology such as artificial intelligence and deep learning, the potential of big data is poised to be harnessed to its maximal in years to come. In ophthalmology, given the data-intensive nature of this specialty, big data will similarly play an important role. Electronic medical records, administrative and health insurance databases, mega national biobanks, crowd source data from mobile applications and social media, and international epidemiology consortia are emerging forms of ""big data"" in ophthalmology. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of big data, its potential applications in ophthalmology, and the challenges in leveraging and using these data. Importantly, in the next phase of work, it will be pertinent to further translate ""big data"" findings into real-world applications, to improve quality of eye care, and cost-effectiveness and efficiency of health services in ophthalmology.",0
"Machine learning (ML) has a well-established reputation for successfully enabling automation through its scalable predictive power. Industry 4.0 encapsulates a new stage of industrial processes and value chains driven by smart connection and automation. Large-scale problems within these industrial settings are a prime example of an environment that can benefit from ML. However, a clear view of how ML currently intersects with industry 4.0 is difficult to grasp without reading an infeasible number of papers. This systematic review strives to provide such a view by gathering a collection of 45,783 relevant papers from Scopus and Web of Science and analysing it with BERTopic. We analyse the key topics to understand what industry applications receive the most attention and which ML methods are used the most. Moreover, we manually reviewed 17 white papers of consulting firms to compare the academic landscape to an industry perspective. We found that security and predictive maintenance were the most common topics, CNNs were the most used ML method and industry companies, at the moment, generally focus more on enabling successful adoption rather than building better ML models. The academic topics are meaningful and relevant but technology focused on making ML adoption easier deserves more attention.",0
"Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are generally considered to be the next generation of engineered systems. However, the actual application of CPSs in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is still at a low level. The sensing method in the construction process plays a very important role in the establishment of CPSs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the application potential of computer vision-based sensing methods and provide practical suggestions through a literature review. This paper provides a review of the current application of CPSs in the AEC industry, summarizes the current knowledge gaps, and discusses the problems with the current construction site sensing approach. Considering the unique advantages of the computer vision (CV) method at the construction site, the application of CV for different construction entities was reviewed and summarized to achieve a CV-based construction site sensing approach for construction process CPSs. The potential of CPS can be further stimulated by providing rich information from on-site sensing using CV methods. According to the review, this approach has unique advantages in the specific environment of the construction site. Based on the current knowledge gap identified in the literature review, this paper proposes a novel concept of visual-based construction site sensing method for CPS application, and an architecture for CV-based CPS is proposed as an implementation of this concept. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a CPS architecture using computer vision as the main information acquisition method based on the literature review. This architecture innovatively introduces computer vision as a sensing method of construction sites, and realizes low-cost and non-invasive information acquisition in complex construction scenarios. This method can be used as an important supplement to on-site sensing to further promote the automation and intelligence of the construction process.",0

"Automated systems for high-input data collection and data storage have led to exponential growth in the availability of information. Such datasets and the tools applied to them have been referred to as 'big data'. Starting with a systematic review of the terms 'informatics, bioinformatics and big data' in animal health this special issue of AHRR illustrates some big-data applications with papers on how the use of various omics methods may be used to facilitate the development of improved diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines for foodborne pathogens in poultry and on how a better understanding of rumen microbiota could lead to improved feed absorption while minimizing methane production. Other papers in this issue cover the use of big data modeling in dairy cattle for more effective disease interventions and machine learning tools for livestock breeding. The final two reviews describe the use of big data in better vector-borne pathogen forecasts with canine seroprevalence maps and modeling approaches to understand the transmission of avian influenza virus. Although a lot of technical and ethical issues remain with the use of big data, these reviews illustrate the tremendous potential that big-data systems have to revolutionize animal health research.",0

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods from computer science and statistics to extract insights or knowledge from data in a specific domain. The results from the combination of the two would provide new evidence for developing the strategies and measures on disease prevention and control.

"Robotic surgery is a reality. In order to to understand how new robots work is interesting to know the history of ancient (see part i) and modern robotics. The desire to design automatic machines imitating humans continued for more than 4000 years. Archytas of Tarentum (at around 400 a.C.), Heron of Alexandria, Hsieh-Fec, Al-Jazari, Bacon, Turriano, Leonardo da Vinci, Vaucanson o von Kempelen were robot inventors. At 1942 Asimov published the three robotics laws. Mechanics, electronics and informatics advances at XXth century developed robots to be able to do very complex self governing works. At 1985 the robot PUMA 560 was employed to introduce a needle inside the brain. Later on, they were designed surgical robots like World First, Robodoc, Gaspar o Acrobot, Zeus, AESOP, Probot o PAKI-RCP. At 2000 the FDA approved the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), a very sophisticated robot to assist surgeons. Currently urological procedures like prostatectomy, cystectomy and nephrectomy are performed with the da Vinci, so urology has become a very suitable speciality to robotic surgery.",0
"Advances in deep learning are providing a powerful set of image analysis tools that are readily accessible for high-throughput phenotyping applications in plant reproductive biology. High-throughput phenotyping systems are becoming critical for answering biological questions on a large scale. These systems have historically relied on traditional computer vision techniques. However, neural networks and specifically deep learning are rapidly becoming more powerful and easier to implement. Here, we examine how deep learning can drive phenotyping systems and be used to answer fundamental questions in reproductive biology. We describe previous applications of deep learning in the plant sciences, provide general recommendations for applying these methods to the study of plant reproduction, and present a case study in maize ear phenotyping. Finally, we highlight several examples where deep learning has enabled research that was previously out of reach and discuss the future outlook of these methods.",0
"During mammographic image acquisition, a compression paddle is used to even the breast thickness in order to obtain optimal image quality. Clinical observation has indicated that some mammograms may exhibit abrupt intensity change and low visibility of tissue structures in the breast peripheral areas. Such appearance discrepancies can affect image interpretation and may not be desirable for computer aided mammography, leading to incorrect diagnosis and/or detection which can have a negative impact on sensitivity and specificity of screening mammography. This paper describes a novel mammographic image pre-processing method to improve image quality for analysis. An image selection process is incorporated to better target problematic images. The processed images show improved mammographic appearances not only in the breast periphery but also across the mammograms. Mammographic segmentation and risk/density classification were performed to facilitate a quantitative and qualitative evaluation. When using the processed images, the results indicated more anatomically correct segmentation in tissue specific areas, and subsequently better classification accuracies were achieved. Visual assessments were conducted in a clinical environment to determine the quality of the processed images and the resultant segmentation. The developed method has shown promising results. It is expected to be useful in early breast cancer detection, risk-stratified screening, and aiding radiologists in the process of decision making prior to surgery and/or treatment.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Intraoperative skills assessment is time-consuming and subjective; an efficient and objective computer vision-based approach for feedback is desired. In this work, we aim to design and validate an interpretable automated method to evaluate technical proficiency using colorectal robotic surgery videos with artificial intelligence.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      92 curated clips of peritoneal closure were characterized by both board-certified surgeons and a computer vision AI algorithm to compare the measures of surgical skill. For human ratings, six surgeons graded clips according to the GEARS assessment tool; for AI assessment, deep learning computer vision algorithms for surgical tool detection and tracking were developed and implemented.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For the GEARS category of efficiency, we observe a positive correlation between human expert ratings of technical efficiency and AI-determined total tool movement (r = - 0.72). Additionally, we show that more proficient surgeons perform closure with significantly less tool movement compared to less proficient surgeons (p < 0.001). For the GEARS category of bimanual dexterity, a positive correlation between expert ratings of bimanual dexterity and the AI model's calculated measure of bimanual movement based on simultaneous tool movement (r = 0.48) was also observed. On average, we also find that higher skill clips have significantly more simultaneous movement in both hands compared to lower skill clips (p < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this study, measurements of technical proficiency extracted from AI algorithms are shown to correlate with those given by expert surgeons. Although we target measurements of efficiency and bimanual dexterity, this work suggests that artificial intelligence through computer vision holds promise for efficiently standardizing grading of surgical technique, which may help in surgical skills training.",0
"Molecular representation learning plays an important role in molecular property prediction. Existing molecular property prediction models rely on the de facto standard of covalent-bond-based molecular graphs for representing molecular topology at the atomic level and totally ignore the non-covalent interactions within the molecule. In this study, we propose a molecular geometric deep learning model to predict the properties of molecules that aims to comprehensively consider the information of covalent and non-covalent interactions of molecules. The essential idea is to incorporate a more general molecular representation into geometric deep learning (GDL) models. We systematically test molecular GDL (Mol-GDL) on fourteen commonly used benchmark datasets. The results show that Mol-GDL can achieve a better performance than state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive tests have demonstrated the important role of non-covalent interactions in molecular property prediction and the effectiveness of Mol-GDL models.",0
"We prove some new results concerning the approximation rate of neural networks with general activation functions. Our first result concerns the rate of approximation of a two layer neural network with a polynomially-decaying non-sigmoidal activation function. We extend the dimension independent approximation rates previously obtained to this new class of activation functions. Our second result gives a weaker, but still dimension independent, approximation rate for a larger class of activation functions, removing the polynomial decay assumption. This result applies to any bounded, integrable activation function. Finally, we show that a stratified sampling approach can be used to improve the approximation rate for polynomially decaying activation functions under mild additional assumptions.",0

"Objective:
        
      
      This paper explores the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) on the management of healthcare data and information and how AI technologies will affect the responsibilities and work of health information management (HIM) professionals.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature review was conducted of both peer-reviewed literature and published opinions on current and future use of AI technology to collect, store, and use healthcare data. The authors also sought insights from key HIM leaders via semi-structured interviews conducted both on the phone and by email.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The following HIM practices are impacted by AI technologies: 1) Automated medical coding and capturing AI-based information; 2) Healthcare data management and data governance; 3) Fbtient privacy and confidentiality; and 4) HIM workforce training and education.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      HIM professionals must focus on improving the quality of coded data that is being used to develop AI applications. HIM professional's ability to identify data patterns will be an important skill as automation advances, though additional skills in data analysis tools and techniques are needed. In addition, HIM professionals should consider how current patient privacy practices apply to AI application, development, and use.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      AI technology will continue to evolve as will the role of HIM professionals who are in a unique position to take on emerging roles with their depth of knowledge on the sources and origins of healthcare data. The challenge for HIM professionals is to identify leading practices for the management of healthcare data and information in an AI-enabled world.",0
"Standardised medical terminologies are used to ensure accurate and consistent communication of information and to facilitate data exchange. Currently, many terminologies are only available in English, which hinders international research and automated processing of medical data. Natural language processing (NLP) and Machine Translation (MT) methods can be used to automatically translate these terms. This scoping review examines the research on automated translation of standardised medical terminology. A search was performed in PubMed and Web of Science and results were screened for eligibility by title and abstract as well as full text screening. In addition to bibliographic data, the following data items were considered: 'terminology considered', 'terms considered', 'source language', 'target language', 'translation type', 'NLP technique', 'NLP system', 'machine translation system', 'data source' and 'translation quality'. The results showed that the most frequently translated terminology is SNOMED CT (39.1%), followed by MeSH (13%), ICD (13%) and UMLS (8.7%). The most common source language is English (55.9%), and the most common target language is German (41.2%). Translation methods are often based on Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) (41.7%) and, more recently, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) (30.6%), but can also be combined with various MT methods. Commercial translators such as Google Translate (36.4%) and automatic validation methods such as BLEU (22.2%) are frequently used tools for translation and subsequent validation.",0
"We consider efficiency in the implementation of deep neural networks. Hardware accelerators are gaining interest as machine learning becomes one of the drivers of high-performance computing. In these accelerators, the directed graph describing a neural network can be implemented as a directed graph describing a Boolean circuit. We make this observation precise, leading naturally to an understanding of practical neural networks as discrete functions, and show that the so-called binarized neural networks are functionally complete. In general, our results suggest that it is valuable to consider Boolean circuits as neural networks, leading to the question of which circuit topologies are promising. We argue that continuity is central to generalization in learning, explore the interaction between data coding, network topology, and node functionality for continuity and pose some open questions for future research. As a first step to bridging the gap between continuous and Boolean views of neural network accelerators, we present some recent results from our work on LUTNet, a novel Field-Programmable Gate Array inference approach. Finally, we conclude with additional possible fruitful avenues for research bridging the continuous and discrete views of neural networks. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Numerical algorithms for high-performance computational science'.",0
"Although the effects of negative reinforcement on human behavior have been studied for a number of years, a comprehensive body of applied research does not exist at this time. This article describes three aspects of negative reinforcement as it relates to applied behavior analysis: behavior acquired or maintained through negative reinforcement, the treatment of negatively reinforced behavior, and negative reinforcement as therapy. A consideration of research currently being done in these areas suggests the emergence of an applied technology on negative reinforcement.",0
"The shiitake mushroom is the second-largest edible mushroom in the world, with a high nutritional and medicinal value. The surface texture of shiitake mushrooms can be quite different due to different growing environments, consequently leading to fluctuating market prices. To maximize the economic profit of the mushroom industry, it is necessary to sort the harvested mushrooms according to their qualities. This paper aimed to develop a deep-learning-based wireless visual sensor system for shiitake mushroom sorting, in which the visual detection was realized by the collection of images and cooperative transmission with the help of visual sensors and Wi-Fi modules, respectively. The model training process was achieved using Vision Transformer, then three data-augmentation methods, which were Random Erasing, RandAugment, and Label Smoothing, were applied under the premise of a small sample dataset. The training result of the final model turned out nearly perfect, with an accuracy rate reaching 99.2%. Meanwhile, the actual mushroom-sorting work using the developed system obtained an accuracy of 98.53%, with an 8.7 ms processing time for every single image. The results showed that the system could efficiently complete the sorting of shiitake mushrooms with a stable and high accuracy. In addition, the system could be extended for other sorting tasks based on visual features. It is also possible to combine binocular vision and multisensor technology with the current system to deal with sorting work that requires a higher accuracy and minor feature identification.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Image processing plays an important role in optimizing image quality and radiation dose in projection radiography. Unfortunately commercial algorithms are black boxes that are often left at or near vendor default settings rather than being optimized.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We hypothesize that different commercial image-processing systems, when left at or near default settings, create significant differences in image quality. We further hypothesize that image-quality differences can be exploited to produce images of equivalent quality but lower radiation dose.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We used a portable radiography system to acquire images on a neonatal chest phantom and recorded the entrance surface air kerma (ESAK). We applied two image-processing systems (Optima XR220amx, by GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI; and MUSICA(2) by Agfa HealthCare, Mortsel, Belgium) to the images. Seven observers (attending pediatric radiologists and radiology residents) independently assessed image quality using two methods: rating and matching. Image-quality ratings were independently assessed by each observer on a 10-point scale. Matching consisted of each observer matching GE-processed images and Agfa-processed images with equivalent image quality. A total of 210 rating tasks and 42 matching tasks were performed and effective dose was estimated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median Agfa-processed image-quality ratings were higher than GE-processed ratings. Non-diagnostic ratings were seen over a wider range of doses for GE-processed images than for Agfa-processed images. During matching tasks, observers matched image quality between GE-processed images and Agfa-processed images acquired at a lower effective dose (11 ± 9 μSv; P < 0.0001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Image-processing methods significantly impact perceived image quality. These image-quality differences can be exploited to alter protocols and produce images of equivalent image quality but lower doses. Those purchasing projection radiography systems or third-party image-processing software should be aware that image processing can significantly impact image quality when settings are left near default values.",0
"Objective: To evaluate the performance of computer vision models for automated kidney stone segmentation during flexible ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy. Materials and Methods: We collected 20 ureteroscopy videos of intrarenal kidney stone treatment and extracted frames (N = 578) from these videos. We manually annotated kidney stones on each frame. Eighty percent of the data were used to train three standard computer vision models (U-Net, U-Net++, and DenseNet) for automatic stone segmentation during flexible ureteroscopy. The remaining data (20%) were used to compare performance of the three models after optimization through Dice coefficients and binary cross entropy. We identified the highest performing model and evaluated automatic segmentation performance during ureteroscopy for both stone localization and treatment using a separate set of endoscopic videos. We evaluated performance of the pixel-based analysis using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and positive predictive value both in previously recorded videos and in real time. Results: A computer vision model (U-Net++) was evaluated, trained, and optimized for kidney stone segmentation during ureteroscopy using 20 surgical videos (mean video duration of 22 seconds, standard deviation ±13 seconds). The model showed good performance for stone localization with both digital ureteroscopes (AUC-ROC: 0.98) and fiberoptic ureteroscopes (AUC-ROC: 0.93). Furthermore, the model was able to accurately segment stones and stone fragments <270 μm in diameter during laser fragmentation (AUC-ROC: 0.87) and dusting (AUC-ROC: 0.77). The model automatically annotated videos intraoperatively in three cases and could do so in real time at 30 frames per second (FPS). Conclusion: Computer vision models demonstrate strong performance for automatic stone segmentation during ureteroscopy. Automatically annotating new videos at 30 FPS demonstrate the feasibility of real-time application during surgery, which could facilitate tracking tools for stone treatment.",0
"Biomedical image processing is a very broad field; it covers biomedical signal gathering, image forming, picture processing, and image display to medical diagnosis based on features extracted from images. This article reviews this topic in both its fundamentals and applications. In its fundamentals, some basic image processing techniques including outlining, deblurring, noise cleaning, filtering, search, classical analysis and texture analysis have been reviewed together with examples. The state-of-the-art image processing systems have been introduced and discussed in two categories: general purpose image processing systems and image analyzers. In order for these systems to be effective for biomedical applications, special biomedical image processing languages have to be developed. The combination of both hardware and software leads to clinical imaging devices. Two different types of clinical imaging devices have been discussed. There are radiological imagings which include radiography, thermography, ultrasound, nuclear medicine and CT. Among these, thermography is the most noninvasive but is limited in application due to the low energy of its source. X-ray CT is excellent for static anatomical images and is moving toward the measurement of dynamic function, whereas nuclear imaging is moving toward organ metabolism and ultrasound is toward tissue physical characteristics. Heart imaging is one of the most interesting and challenging research topics in biomedical image processing; current methods including the invasive-technique cineangiography, and noninvasive ultrasound, nuclear medicine, transmission, and emission CT methodologies have been reviewed. Two current federally funded research projects in heart imaging, the dynamic spatial reconstructor and the dynamic cardiac three-dimensional densitometer, should bring some fruitful results in the near future. Miscrosopic imaging technique is very different from the radiological imaging technique in the sense that interaction between the operator and the imaging device is very essential. The white blood cell analyzer has been developed to the point that it becomes a daily clinical imaging device. An interactive chromosome karyotyper is being clinical evaluated and its preliminary indication is very encouraging. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to automation of cancer cytology; it is hoped that some prototypes will be available for clinical trials very soon. Automation of histology is still in its infancy; much work still needs to be done in this area. The 1970s have been very fruitful in utilizing the imaging technique in biomedical application; the computerized tomographic scanner and the white blood cell analyzer being the most successful imaging devices...",0
"Introduction:
        
      
      Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), introduced in 2018, has revolutionized natural language processing. Its bidirectional understanding of word context has enabled innovative applications, notably in radiology. This study aimed to assess BERT's influence and applications within the radiologic domain.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed for literature on BERT-based models and natural language processing in radiology from January 1, 2018, to February 12, 2023. The search encompassed keywords related to generative models, transformer architecture, and various imaging techniques.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 597 results, 30 met our inclusion criteria. The remaining were unrelated to radiology or did not use BERT-based models. The included studies were retrospective, with 14 published in 2022. The primary focus was on classification and information extraction from radiology reports, with x-rays as the prevalent imaging modality. Specific investigations included automatic CT protocol assignment and deep learning applications in chest x-ray interpretation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This review underscores the primary application of BERT in radiology for report classification. It also reveals emerging BERT applications for protocol assignment and report generation. As BERT technology advances, we foresee further innovative applications. Its implementation in radiology holds potential for enhancing diagnostic precision, expediting report generation, and optimizing patient care.",0
"Robotics are now being used in all surgical fields, including general surgery. By increasing intra-abdominal articulations while operating through small incisions, robotics are increasingly being used for a large number of visceral and solid organ operations, including those for the gallbladder, esophagus, stomach, intestines, colon, and rectum, as well as for the endocrine organs. Robotics and general surgery are blending for the first time in history and as a specialty field should continue to grow for many years to come. We continuously demand solutions to questions and limitations that are experienced in our daily work. Laparoscopy is laden with limitations such as fixed axis points at the trocar insertion sites, two-dimensional video monitors, limited dexterity at the instrument tips, lack of haptic sensation, and in some cases poor ergonomics. The creation of a surgical robot system with 3D visual capacity seems to deal with most of these limitations. Although some in the surgical community continue to test the feasibility of these surgical robots and to question the necessity of such an expensive venture, others are already postulating how to improve the next generation of telemanipulators, and in so doing are looking beyond today's horizon to find simpler solutions. As the robotic era enters the world of the general surgeon, more and more complex procedures will be able to be approached through small incisions. As technology catches up with our imaginations, robotic instruments (as opposed to robots) and 3D monitoring will become routine and continue to improve patient care by providing surgeons with the most precise, least traumatic ways of treating surgical disease.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has recently seen rapid advancement, with an expanding role and scope in nursing education and healthcare. This study identifies the influence of AI ethics awareness, attitude toward AI, anxiety, and self-efficacy on nursing students' behavioral intentions to use AI-based healthcare technology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The participants included 189 nursing students in Gyeonggi-do, with data collected from November to December 2021 using self-reported questionnaires. We analyzed the data using the SPSS/WIN 26.0 program, including a t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and hierarchical multiple linear regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results revealed that AI ethical awareness (t = - 4.32, p < .001), positive attitude toward AI (t = - 2.60, p = .010), and self-efficacy (t = - 2.65, p = .009) scores of the third and fourth-year nursing students were higher, while their anxiety scores were lower (t = 2.30, p = .022) compared to the scores of the first and second-year nursing students. The factors influencing behavioral intention included a positive attitude toward AI (β = 0.58) and self-efficacy (β = 0.22). The adjusted R2 was 0.42.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      It is necessary to inculcate a positive attitude toward AI and self-efficacy by providing educational programs on AI-based technology in healthcare settings.",0
"Spontaneous recovery occurs when a previously reinforced and recently extinguished response reemerges over the course of time, often at the beginning of a new session of extinction. Spontaneous recovery could underlie instances of treatment relapse that threaten otherwise effective behavioral interventions for problem behavior. In two experiments, we arranged multiple schedules with pigeons and a human child to assess the effects of different training reinforcer rates on spontaneous recovery. In both experiments, responding was both more resistant to extinction and more likely to relapse following training with greater reinforcement rates upon returning to extinction after time off from extinction testing. A quantitative model based on behavioral momentum theory accounted well for the data, which suggests reexposure to the extinction context following time off during extinction resulted in (1) the failure of extinction learning to generalize, and (2) greater generalization of original learning during training. The present model attempts to quantify theories attributing spontaneous recovery to changes in temporal context.",0
"Introduction:
        
      
      Computers and digital electronic devices have become an integral part of life. These devices have adverse effects and nowadays are considered leading occupational hazards. Computer vision syndrome comprises of all the ocular, visual and musculoskeletal symptoms secondary to long term computer use. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of computer vision syndrome among people attending the outpatient department of ophthalmology in the tertiary care center in Nepal.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A descriptive cross-sectional study was done among 70 patients in a tertiary care hospital from January 2017 to June 2017 after obtaining ethical approval from the institutional review committee (Ref: 12042017). Convenient sampling method was applied and the point estimate at 95% confidence interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. Patients using computers for more than one hour were included in the study. All data were entered in Microsoft Excel and analyzed using statistical package for social sciences version 20.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 70 patients, 67 (95.7%) (87.9-99.1 at 95% confidence interval) had one or more symptoms on computer use. The mean duration of computer use was 7.5Â±5.4 years and average hours of computer use among computer users were 6.9Â±3 hours. The most common symptom among computer users was headache seen in 46 (62.2%) patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study showed that a significant number of people using a computer develop one or more symptoms on the long-term use of the computer. Therefore, it is very important to create awareness regarding computer vision syndrome and methods to prevent it among computer users.",0
"Emotion recognition has become increasingly important in the field of Deep Learning (DL) and computer vision due to its broad applicability by using human-computer interaction (HCI) in areas such as psychology, healthcare, and entertainment. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of facial and pose emotion recognition using DL and computer vision, analyzing and evaluating 77 papers from different sources under Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our review covers several topics, including the scope and purpose of the studies, the methods employed, and the used datasets. The scope of this work is to conduct a systematic review of facial and pose emotion recognition using DL methods and computer vision. The studies were categorized based on a proposed taxonomy that describes the type of expressions used for emotion detection, the testing environment, the currently relevant DL methods, and the datasets used. The taxonomy of methods in our review includes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT), and ""Other NNs"", which are the most commonly used models in the analyzed studies, indicating their trendiness in the field. Hybrid and augmented models are not explicitly categorized within this taxonomy, but they are still important to the field. This review offers an understanding of state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms and datasets for emotion recognition through facial expressions and body poses, allowing researchers to understand its fundamental components and trends.",0
"While the technologies that enable Artificial Intelligence (AI) continue to advance rapidly, there are increasing promises regarding AI's beneficial outputs and concerns about the challenges of human-computer interaction in healthcare. To address these concerns, institutions have increasingly resorted to publishing AI guidelines for healthcare, aiming to align AI with ethical practices. However, guidelines as a form of written language can be analyzed to recognize the reciprocal links between its textual communication and underlying societal ideas. From this perspective, we conducted a discourse analysis to understand how these guidelines construct, articulate, and frame ethics for AI in healthcare. We included eight guidelines and identified three prevalent and interwoven discourses: (1) AI is unavoidable and desirable; (2) AI needs to be guided with (some forms of) principles (3) trust in AI is instrumental and primary. These discourses signal an over-spillage of technical ideals to AI ethics, such as over-optimism and resulting hyper-criticism. This research provides insights into the underlying ideas present in AI guidelines and how guidelines influence the practice and alignment of AI with ethical, legal, and societal values expected to shape AI in healthcare.",0
"Nearly all lineages of land plants have experienced at least one whole-genome duplication (WGD) in their history. The legacy of these ancient WGDs is still observable in the diploidized genomes of extant plants. Genes originating from WGD-paleologs-can be maintained in diploidized genomes for millions of years. These paleologs have the potential to shape plant evolution through sub- and neofunctionalization, increased genetic diversity, and reciprocal gene loss among lineages. Current methods for classifying paleologs often rely on only a subset of potential genomic features, have varying levels of accuracy, and often require significant data and/or computational time. Here, we developed a supervised machine learning approach to classify paleologs from a target WGD in diploidized genomes across a broad range of different duplication histories. We collected empirical data on syntenic block sizes and other genomic features from 27 plant species each with a different history of paleopolyploidy. Features from these genomes were used to develop simulations of syntenic blocks and paleologs to train a gradient boosted decision tree. Using this approach, Frackify (Fractionation Classify), we were able to accurately identify and classify paleologs across a broad range of parameter space, including cases with multiple overlapping WGDs. We then compared Frackify with other paleolog inference approaches in six species with paleotetraploid and paleohexaploid ancestries. Frackify provides a way to combine multiple genomic features to quickly classify paleologs while providing a high degree of consistency with existing approaches.",0
"The present study investigated the effects of variability requirements on learning difficult target sequences in humans. Twenty university students emitted five-response sequences. For the experimental groups, 30 nontarget sequences were reinforced according to the Lag-10 variation criterion or the Lag-3 repetition criterion across conditions. For the control groups, the probability of reinforcers for nontarget sequences was yoked to that obtained by the experimental groups. In addition, for both groups, two difficult target sequences were continuously reinforced. U values were higher with the Lag-10 variation criterion than with the Lag-3 repetition criterion for the experimental groups and were unsystematic for the control groups. Higher U values ​​were accompanied by a random pattern in the emission of nontarget sequences for all groups. Higher levels of variability, regardless of whether they were directly produced by reinforcement or were contingency induced, facilitated learning of difficult target sequences.",0
"Objective:
        
      
      This article methodically reviews the literature on deep learning (DL) for natural language processing (NLP) in the clinical domain, providing quantitative analysis to answer 3 research questions concerning methods, scope, and context of current research.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics Anthology for articles using DL-based approaches to NLP problems in electronic health records. After screening 1,737 articles, we collected data on 25 variables across 212 papers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      DL in clinical NLP publications more than doubled each year, through 2018. Recurrent neural networks (60.8%) and word2vec embeddings (74.1%) were the most popular methods; the information extraction tasks of text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction were dominant (89.2%). However, there was a ""long tail"" of other methods and specific tasks. Most contributions were methodological variants or applications, but 20.8% were new methods of some kind. The earliest adopters were in the NLP community, but the medical informatics community was the most prolific.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Our analysis shows growing acceptance of deep learning as a baseline for NLP research, and of DL-based NLP in the medical community. A number of common associations were substantiated (eg, the preference of recurrent neural networks for sequence-labeling named entity recognition), while others were surprisingly nuanced (eg, the scarcity of French language clinical NLP with deep learning).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Deep learning has not yet fully penetrated clinical NLP and is growing rapidly. This review highlighted both the popular and unique trends in this active field.",0
"Machine Learning (ML) techniques provide the ability to effectively evaluate and analyze human skin and hair assessments. The aim of this study is to systematically review the effectiveness of applying Machine Learning (ML) methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in order to evaluate hair and skin assessments. PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct were searched in order to retrieve research publications between 1 January 2010 and 31 March 2020 using appropriate keywords such as ""hair and skin analysis."" Following accurate screening, 20 peer-reviewed publications were selected for inclusion in this systematic review. The analysis demonstrated that prevalent Machine Learning (ML) methods comprised of Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-nearest Neighbor, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). ANN's were observed to yield the highest accuracy of 95% followed by SVM generating 90%. These techniques were most commonly applied for drafting framework assessments such as that of Melanoma. Values of parameters such as Sensitivity, Specificity, and Area under the Curve (AUC) were extracted from the studies and with the help of comparisons, relevant inferences were also made. ANN's were observed to yield the highest sensitivity of 82.30% as well as a 96.90% specificity. Hence, with this systematic review, a summarization of the studies was drafted that encapsulated how Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been employed for the analysis and evaluation of hair and skin assessments.",0
"Aims and objectives:
        
      
      To examine the nature and use of automation in contemporary clinical information systems by reviewing studies reporting the implementation and evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in healthcare settings.
    


          Method:
        
      
      PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, the tables of contents of major informatics journals, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies reporting evaluation of AI in clinical settings from January 2021 to December 2022. We documented the clinical application areas and tasks supported, and the level of system autonomy. Reported effects on user experience, decision-making, care delivery and outcomes were summarised.
    


          Results:
        
      
      AI technologies are being applied in a wide variety of clinical areas. Most contemporary systems utilise deep learning, use routinely collected data, support diagnosis and triage, are assistive (requiring users to confirm or approve AI provided information or decisions), and are used by doctors in acute care settings in high-income nations. AI systems are integrated and used within existing clinical information systems including electronic medical records. There is limited support for One Health goals. Evaluation is largely based on quantitative methods measuring effects on decision-making.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      AI systems are being implemented and evaluated in many clinical areas. There remain many opportunities to understand patterns of routine use and evaluate effects on decision-making, care delivery and patient outcomes using mixed-methods. Support for One Health including integrating data about environmental factors and social determinants needs further exploration.",0
"Aim:
        
      
      To examine computed tomography (CT) radiomic feature stability on various texture patterns during pre-processing utilizing the Credence Cartridge Radiomics (CCR) phantom textures.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Imaging Biomarker Explorer (IBEX) expansion for the abbreviation IBEX extracted 51 radiomic features of 4 categories from 11 textures image regions of interest (ROI) of the phantom. 19 software pre-processing algorithms processed each CCR phantom ROI. All ROI texture processed image features were retrieved. Pre-processed CT image radiomic features were compared to non-processed features to measure its textural influence. Wilcoxon T-tests measured the pre-processing relevance of CT radiomic features on various textures. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed to cluster processer potency and texture impression likeness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The pre-processing filter, CT texture Cartridge, and feature category affect the CCR phantom CT image's radiomic properties. Pre-processing is statistically unaltered by Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM ) expansion for the abbreviation GLRLM and Neighborhood Intensity Difference matrix (NID) expansion for the abbreviation NID feature categories. The 30%, 40%, and 50% honeycomb are regular directional textures and smooth 3D-printed plaster resin, most of the image pre-processing feature alterations exhibited significant p-values in the histogram feature category. The Laplacian Filter, Log Filter, Resample, and Bit Depth Rescale Range pre-processing algorithms hugely influenced histogram and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) image features.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We found that homogenous intensity phantom inserts, CT radiomic feature, are less sensitive to feature swaps during pre-processing than normal directed honeycomb and regular projected smooth 3D-printed plaster resin CT image textures. Because they lose fewer information during image enhancement, This feature concentration empowerment of the images also enhances texture pattern recognition.",0
"Images produced by CMOS sensors may contain defective pixels due to noise, manufacturing errors, or device malfunction, which must be detected and corrected at early processing stages in order to produce images that are useful to human users and image-processing or machine-vision algorithms. This paper proposes a defective pixel detection and correction algorithm and its implementation using CMOS analog circuits, which are integrated with the image sensor at the pixel and column levels. During photocurrent integration, the circuit detects defective values in parallel at each pixel using simple arithmetic operations within a neighborhood. At the image-column level, the circuit replaces the defective pixels with the median value of their neighborhood. To validate our approach, we designed a 128×128-pixel imager in a 0.35μm CMOS process, which integrates our defective-pixel detection/correction circuits and processes images at 694 frames per second, according to post-layout simulations. Operating at that frame rate, our proposed algorithm and its CMOS implementation produce better results than current state-of-the-art algorithms: it achieves a Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Image Enhancement Factor (IEF) of 45 dB and 198.4, respectively, in images with 0.5% random defective pixels, and a PSNR of 44.4 dB and IEF of 194.2, respectively, in images with 1.0% random defective pixels.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI) has increasing clinical relevance for therapeutic applications in mental health services. With innovations ranging from 'virtual psychotherapists' to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; 'gaps' in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.",0
"Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide, and nicotine, the primary psychoactive constituent in tobacco, drives sustained use. The behavioral actions of nicotine are complex and extend well beyond the actions of the drug as a primary reinforcer. Stimuli that are consistently paired with nicotine can, through associative learning, take on reinforcing properties as conditioned stimuli. These conditioned stimuli can then impact the rate and probability of behavior and even function as conditioning reinforcers that maintain behavior in the absence of nicotine. Nicotine can also act as a conditioned stimulus (CS), predicting the delivery of other reinforcers, which may allow nicotine to acquire value as a conditioned reinforcer. These associative effects, establishing non-nicotine stimuli as conditioned stimuli with discriminative stimulus and conditioned reinforcing properties as well as establishing nicotine as a CS, are predicted by basic conditioning principles. However, nicotine can also act non-associatively. Nicotine directly enhances the reinforcing efficacy of other reinforcing stimuli in the environment, an effect that does not require a temporal or predictive relationship between nicotine and either the stimulus or the behavior. Hence, the reinforcing actions of nicotine stem both from the primary reinforcing actions of the drug (and the subsequent associative learning effects) as well as the reinforcement enhancement action of nicotine which is non-associative in nature. Gaining a better understanding of how nicotine impacts behavior will allow for maximally effective tobacco control efforts aimed at reducing the harm associated with tobacco use by reducing and/or treating its addictiveness.",0
"Radiation oncology has always been deeply rooted in modeling, from the early days of isoeffect curves to the contemporary Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) initiative. In recent years, medical modeling for both prognostic and therapeutic purposes has exploded thanks to increasing availability of electronic data and genomics. One promising direction that medical modeling is moving toward is adopting the same machine learning methods used by companies such as Google and Facebook to combat disease. Broadly defined, machine learning is a branch of computer science that deals with making predictions from complex data through statistical models. These methods serve to uncover patterns in data and are actively used in areas such as speech recognition, handwriting recognition, face recognition, ""spam"" filtering (junk email), and targeted advertising. Although multiple radiation oncology research groups have shown the value of applied machine learning (ML), clinical adoption has been slow due to the high barrier to understanding these complex models by clinicians. Here, we present a review of the use of ML to predict radiation therapy outcomes from the clinician's point of view with the hope that it lowers the ""barrier to entry"" for those without formal training in ML. We begin by describing 7 principles that one should consider when evaluating (or creating) an ML model in radiation oncology. We next introduce 3 popular ML methods--logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN)--and critique 3 seminal papers in the context of these principles. Although current studies are in exploratory stages, the overall methodology has progressively matured, and the field is ready for larger-scale further investigation.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Robotic neurosurgery may improve the accuracy, speed, and availability of stereotactic procedures. We recently developed a computer vision and artificial intelligence-driven frameless stereotaxy for nonimmobilized patients, creating an opportunity to develop accurate and rapidly deployable robots for bedside cranial intervention.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To validate a portable stereotactic surgical robot capable of frameless registration, real-time tracking, and accurate bedside catheter placement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Four human cadavers were used to evaluate the robot's ability to maintain low surface registration and targeting error for 72 intracranial targets during head motion, ie, without rigid cranial fixation. Twenty-four intracranial catheters were placed robotically at predetermined targets. Placement accuracy was verified by computed tomography imaging.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Robotic tracking of the moving cadaver heads occurred with a program runtime of 0.111 ± 0.013 seconds, and the movement command latency was only 0.002 ± 0.003 seconds. For surface error tracking, the robot sustained a 0.588 ± 0.105 mm registration accuracy during dynamic head motions (velocity of 6.647 ± 2.360 cm/s). For the 24 robotic-assisted intracranial catheter placements, the target registration error was 0.848 ± 0.590 mm, providing a user error of 0.339 ± 0.179 mm.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robotic-assisted stereotactic procedures on mobile subjects were feasible with this robot and computer vision image guidance technology. Frameless robotic neurosurgery potentiates surgery on nonimmobilized and awake patients both in the operating room and at the bedside. It can affect the field through improving the safety and ability to perform procedures such as ventriculostomy, stereo electroencephalography, biopsy, and potentially other novel procedures. If we envision catheter misplacement as a ""never event,"" robotics can facilitate that reality.",0
"Minimally invasive procedures assisted by soft robots for surgery, diagnostics, and drug delivery have unprecedented benefits over traditional solutions from both patient and surgeon perspectives. However, the translation of such technology into commercialization remains challenging. The lack of perception abilities is one of the obstructive factors paramount for a safe, accurate and efficient robot-assisted intervention. Integrating different types of miniature sensors onto robotic end-effectors is a promising trend to compensate for the perceptual deficiencies in soft robots. For example, haptic feedback with force sensors helps surgeons to control the interaction force at the tool-tissue interface, impedance sensing of tissue electrical properties can be used for tumor detection. The last decade has witnessed significant progress in the development of multimodal sensors built on the advancement in engineering, material science and scalable micromachining technologies. This review article provides a snapshot on common types of integrated sensors for soft medical robots. It covers various sensing mechanisms, examples for practical and clinical applications, standard manufacturing processes, as well as insights on emerging engineering routes for the fabrication of novel and high-performing sensing devices.",0
"In multi-party deep learning, multiple participants jointly train a deep learning model through a central server to achieve common objectives without sharing their private data. Recently, a significant amount of progress has been made toward the privacy issue of this emerging multi-party deep learning paradigm. In this paper, we mainly focus on two problems in multi-party deep learning. The first problem is that most of the existing works are incapable of defending simultaneously against the attacks of honest-but-curious participants and an honest-but-curious server without a manager trusted by all participants. To tackle this problem, we design a privacy-enhanced multi-party deep learning framework, which integrates differential privacy and homomorphic encryption to prevent potential privacy leakage to other participants and a central server without requiring a manager that all participants trust. The other problem is that existing frameworks consume high total privacy budget when applying differential privacy for preserving privacy, which leads to a high risk of privacy leakage. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose three strategies for dynamically allocating privacy budget at each epoch to further enhance privacy guarantees without compromising the model utility. Moreover, it provides participants with an intuitive handle to strike a balance between the privacy level and the training efficiency by choosing different strategies. Both analytical and experimental evaluations demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed framework.",0
"With the tremendous volume of data captured during surgeries and procedures, critical care, and pain management, the field of anesthesiology is uniquely suited for the application of machine learning, neural networks, and closed loop technologies.

This article provides an overview of the basic tenets of machine learning, neural networks, and closed loop devices, with emphasis on the clinical applications of these technologies.",0
"Data science has the potential to greatly enhance efforts to translate evidence into practice in critical care. The intensive care unit is a data-rich environment enabling insight into both patient-level care patterns and clinician-level treatment patterns. By applying artificial intelligence to these novel data sources, implementation strategies can be tailored to individual patients, individual clinicians, and individual situations, revealing when evidence-based practices are missed and facilitating context-sensitive clinical decision support. To achieve these goals, technology developers should work closely with clinicians to create unbiased applications that are integrated into the clinical workflow.",0
"In recent years, the number of scientific publications on artificial intelligence (AI), primarily on machine learning, with respect to neurosurgery, has increased. The aim of the study was to conduct a systematic literature review and identify the main areas of AI applications in neurosurgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using the PubMed search engine, we found and analyzed 327 original articles published in 1996-2019. The key words specific to each topic were identified using topic modeling algorithms LDA and ARTM, which are part of the AI-based natural language processing.

"The acceptance and use of digital technologies depend on the trustworthiness attributed to them. Experts were interviewed about how they assign trust to digital technologies or AI (N=12). The data were analyzed applying the focused qualitative content analysis. All of the experts have experience with digital technologies, but only seven with AI. The majority of experts generally trust digital technologies, but only five experts expressed a general trust in AI. Similar reasons contributing to trust building were given for digital technologies and AI. The results show the complexity of the trust building process and the construct of trust itself. The development of explainable AI and professional training are prerequisites to support a critical and safe use of these technologies.",0

"Underwater polarization differential imaging requires the estimation of different parameters, and the parameters can be accurately obtained by using optical correlation. However, optical correlation as a criterion function to estimate parameters takes a lot of time. To expedite the parameters' estimation process, we propose two operations to process underwater polarization images. One operation is to update the analyzer angle range to reduce the number of processed images. The other is image downsampling, which reduces the amount of calculation for the corresponding images. In experiments, we confirmed the feasibility of our method. We have obtained an average of 42 times the calculation speed increase under the conditions of updating the analyzer angle range 3 times and reducing the image scale by 16 times. The results of our method are consistent with those of traditional methods. This established method is conducive to the practical application of underwater polarization differential imaging.",0
"Big data management is a key enabling factor for enterprises that want to compete in the global market. Data coming from enterprise production processes, if properly analyzed, can provide a boost in the enterprise management and optimization, guaranteeing faster processes, better customer management, and lower overheads/costs. Guaranteeing a proper big data pipeline is the holy grail of big data, often opposed by the difficulty of evaluating the correctness of the big data pipeline results. This problem is even worse when big data pipelines are provided as a service in the cloud, and must comply with both laws and users' requirements. To this aim, assurance techniques can complete big data pipelines, providing the means to guarantee that they behave correctly, toward the deployment of big data pipelines fully compliant with laws and users' requirements. In this article, we define an assurance solution for big data based on service-level agreements, where a semiautomatic approach supports users from the definition of the requirements to the negotiation of the terms regulating the provisioned services, and the continuous refinement thereof.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Natural language processing applied to clinical text or aimed at a clinical outcome has been thriving in recent years. This paper offers the first broad overview of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) for languages other than English. Recent studies are summarized to offer insights and outline opportunities in this area.
    


          Main body:
        
      
      We envision three groups of intended readers: (1) NLP researchers leveraging experience gained in other languages, (2) NLP researchers faced with establishing clinical text processing in a language other than English, and (3) clinical informatics researchers and practitioners looking for resources in their languages in order to apply NLP techniques and tools to clinical practice and/or investigation. We review work in clinical NLP in languages other than English. We classify these studies into three groups: (i) studies describing the development of new NLP systems or components de novo, (ii) studies describing the adaptation of NLP architectures developed for English to another language, and (iii) studies focusing on a particular clinical application.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We show the advantages and drawbacks of each method, and highlight the appropriate application context. Finally, we identify major challenges and opportunities that will affect the impact of NLP on clinical practice and public health studies in a context that encompasses English as well as other languages.",0
"Resurgence is defined as an increase in the frequency of a previously reinforced target response when an alternative source of reinforcement is suspended. Despite an extensive body of research examining factors that affect resurgence, the effects of alternative-reinforcer magnitude have not been examined. Thus, the present experiments aimed to fill this gap in the literature. In Experiment 1, rats pressed levers for single-pellet reinforcers during Phase 1. In Phase 2, target-lever pressing was extinguished, and alternative-lever pressing produced either five-pellet, one-pellet, or no alternative reinforcement. In Phase 3, alternative reinforcement was suspended to test for resurgence. Five-pellet alternative reinforcement produced faster elimination and greater resurgence of target-lever pressing than one-pellet alternative reinforcement. In Experiment 2, effects of decreasing alternative-reinforcer magnitude on resurgence were examined. Rats pressed levers and pulled chains for six-pellet reinforcers during Phases 1 and 2, respectively. In Phase 3, alternative reinforcement was decreased to three pellets for one group, one pellet for a second group, and suspended altogether for a third group. Shifting from six-pellet to one-pellet alternative reinforcement produced as much resurgence as suspending alternative reinforcement altogether, while shifting from six pellets to three pellets did not produce resurgence. These results suggest that alternative-reinforcer magnitude has effects on elimination and resurgence of target behavior that are similar to those of alternative-reinforcer rate. Thus, both suppression of target behavior during alternative reinforcement and resurgence when conditions of alternative reinforcement are altered may be related to variables that affect the value of the alternative-reinforcement source.",0
"This is the fourth article of our series for radiologists and imaging scientists on displaying, manipulating, and analyzing radiologic images on personal computers. Classic image processing is divided into point, area, frame, and geometric processes. Point processes change image pixel values based on the value of the pixel of interest. Histogram equalization adjusts the pixel values in the image based on the distribution of pixel values. Area processes change the pixel of interest based on the values of the surrounding pixels, known as the neighborhood. Area processes using a convolution kernel are often used as image filters. Common convolution kernels include low-frequency, high-frequency, and edge-enhancement filters. Edge enhancement can be performed with convolution kernels such as shift and difference, gradient-directional and Laplacian filters, or with nonlinear methods such as Sobel's algorithm. Frame processes mathematically combine two or more images, often for noise reduction and background subtraction. Geometric processes alter the location of pixels within the image, but usually not the pixel values. Common radiologic applications of image processing include window width and window level adjustments (point process), adaptive histogram equalization (area process), unsharp masking (area process), computed radiography image processing (combined area and point processes), digital subtraction angiography (frame and geometric processes), region of interest analysis (area process), and image rotation (geometric process). As digital imaging becomes more widespread, radiologists need to understand the image processing that is fundamental to these modalities.",0
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many research areas ranging from traffic to computer vision. With increased interest in cloud-native applications, GNNs are increasingly being investigated to address various challenges in microservice architecture from prototype design to large-scale service deployment. To appreciate the big picture of this emerging trend, we provide a comprehensive review of recent studies leveraging GNNs for microservice-based applications. To begin, we identify the key areas in which GNNs are applied, and then we review in detail how GNNs can be designed to address the challenges in specific areas found in the literature. Finally, we outline potential research directions where GNN-based solutions can be further applied. Our research shows the popularity of leveraging convolutional graph neural networks (ConGNNs) for microservice-based applications in the current design of cloud systems and the emerging area of adopting spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) and dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) for more advanced studies.",0
"Among the various robotic devices that exist for urologic surgery, the most common are synergistic telemanipulator systems. Several have achieved clinical feasibility and have been licensed for use in humans: the standard da Vinci, Avatera, Hinotori, Revo-i, Senhance, Versius, and Surgenius. Handheld and hands-on synergistic systems are also clinically relevant for use in urologic surgeries, including minimally invasive and endoscopic approaches. Future trends of robotic innovation include an exploration of more robust haptic systems that offer kinesthetic and tactile feedback; miniaturization and microrobotics; enhanced visual feedback with greater magnification and higher fidelity detail; and autonomous robots.",0
"Recently, research on the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational toxicology models that predict toxicity without the use of animal testing has emerged because of the rapid development of computer technology. Various computational toxicology techniques that predict toxicity based on the structure of chemical substances are gaining attention, including the quantitative structure-activity relationship. To understand the recent development of these models, we analyzed the databases, molecular descriptors, fingerprints, and algorithms considered in recent studies. Based on a selection of 96 papers published since 2014, we found that AI models have been developed to predict approximately 30 different toxicity end points using more than 20 toxicity databases. For model development, molecular access system and extended-connectivity fingerprints are the most commonly used molecular descriptors. The most used algorithm among the machine learning techniques is the random forest, while the most used algorithm among the deep learning techniques is a deep neural network. The use of AI technology in the development of toxicity prediction models is a new concept that will aid in achieving a scientific accord and meet regulatory applications. The comprehensive overview provided in this study will provide a useful guide for the further development and application of toxicity prediction models.",0
"Computerized clinical decision support (CDS) aims to aid decision making of health care providers and the public by providing easily accessible health-related information at the point and time it is needed. natural language processing (NLP) is instrumental in using free-text information to drive CDS, representing clinical knowledge and CDS interventions in standardized formats, and leveraging clinical narrative. The early innovative NLP research of clinical narrative was followed by a period of stable research conducted at the major clinical centers and a shift of mainstream interest to biomedical NLP. This review primarily focuses on the recently renewed interest in development of fundamental NLP methods and advances in the NLP systems for CDS. The current solutions to challenges posed by distinct sublanguages, intended user groups, and support goals are discussed.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence, which utilises large data sets to make predictions for future events. Although most algorithms used in machine learning were developed as far back as the 1950s, the advent of big data in combination with dramatically increased computing power has spurred renewed interest in this technology over the last two decades.
    


          Main body:
        
      
      Within the medical field, machine learning is promising in the development of assistive clinical tools for detection of e.g. cancers and prediction of disease. Recent advances in deep learning technologies, a sub-discipline of machine learning that requires less user input but more data and processing power, has provided even greater promise in assisting physicians to achieve accurate diagnoses. Within the fields of genetics and its sub-field epigenetics, both prime examples of complex data, machine learning methods are on the rise, as the field of personalised medicine is aiming for treatment of the individual based on their genetic and epigenetic profiles.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We now have an ever-growing number of reported epigenetic alterations in disease, and this offers a chance to increase sensitivity and specificity of future diagnostics and therapies. Currently, there are limited studies using machine learning applied to epigenetics. They pertain to a wide variety of disease states and have used mostly supervised machine learning methods.",0
"Animal trainers and others often recommend the use of jackpot reinforcers, which are disproportionally large and come as a ""surprise"" to the animals. Because the actual behavioral effects of these jackpots remain uninvestigated, many basic questions about their use and even definition are unanswered. This series of experiments explored the definitions of jackpots using several different behavioral tests with both rats and pigeons. Because the original description of a jackpot resembled the reinstatement of previously reinforced and extinguished responding with response-independent deliveries of reinforcer, reinstatement effects of a jackpot, defined by its quality, were examined with rats in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, response-potentiating effects of response-independent and -dependent deliveries of a jackpot, defined by its quantity, were assessed with pigeons when responding had nearly ceased. The response-potentiating effects of the frequency of jackpot-reinforcer delivery were investigated when responding of pigeons was maintained in single (Experiment 3) or concurrent (Experiment 4) schedules of reinforcement. Effects of jackpots on resistance to change were assessed with rats in Experiment 5. The effects of jackpots in each experiment were either absent or unsystematic across the subjects, casting doubt on their utility in animal training. Possible factors contributing to the negative results are discussed.",0
"Proteins with desired functions and properties are important in fields like nanotechnology and biomedicine. De novo protein design enables the production of previously unseen proteins from the ground up and is believed as a key point for handling real social challenges. Recent introduction of deep learning into design methods exhibits a transformative influence and is expected to represent a promising and exciting future direction. In this review, we retrospect the major aspects of current advances in deep-learning-based design procedures and illustrate their novelty in comparison with conventional knowledge-based approaches through noticeable cases. We not only describe deep learning developments in structure-based protein design and direct sequence design, but also highlight recent applications of deep reinforcement learning in protein design. The future perspectives on design goals, challenges and opportunities are also comprehensively discussed.",0
"Background:
        
      
      This review explores the bioethical implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine and in ophthalmology. AI, which was first introduced in the 1950s, is defined as ""the machine simulation of human mental reasoning, decision making, and behavior"". The increased power of computing, expansion of storage capacity, and compilation of medical big data helped the AI implementation surge in medical practice and research. Ophthalmology is a leading medical specialty in applying AI in screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The first Food and Drug Administration approved autonomous diagnostic system served to diagnose and classify diabetic retinopathy. Other ophthalmic conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, and congenital cataract, among others, implemented AI too.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      To review the contemporary literature of the bioethical issues of AI in medicine and ophthalmology, classify ethical issues in medical AI, and suggest possible standardizations of ethical frameworks for AI implementation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Keywords were searched on Google Scholar and PubMed between October 2019 and April 2020. The results were reviewed, cross-referenced, and summarized. A total of 284 references including articles, books, book chapters, and regulatory reports and statements were reviewed, and those that were relevant were cited in the paper.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Most sources that studied the use of AI in medicine explored the ethical aspects. Bioethical challenges of AI implementation in medicine were categorized into 6 main categories. These include machine training ethics, machine accuracy ethics, patient-related ethics, physician-related ethics, shared ethics, and roles of regulators.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There are multiple stakeholders in the ethical issues surrounding AI in medicine and ophthalmology. Attention to the various aspects of ethics related to AI is important especially with the expanding use of AI. Solutions of ethical problems are envisioned to be multifactorial.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI), a major frontier in the field of medical research, can potentially lead to a paradigm shift in clinical practice. A type of artificial intelligence system known as convolutional neural network points to the possible utility of deep learning in dermatopathology. Though pathology has been traditionally restricted to microscopes and glass slides, recent advancement in digital pathological imaging has led to a transition making it a potential branch for the implementation of artificial intelligence. The current application of artificial intelligence in dermatopathology is to complement the diagnosis and requires a well-trained dermatopathologist's guidance for better designing and development of deep learning algorithms. Here we review the recent advances of artificial intelligence in dermatopathology, its applications in disease diagnosis and in research, along with its limitations and future potential.",0
"Deep learning techniques have recently been successful in the classification of brain evoked responses for multiple applications, including brain-machine interface. Single-trial detection in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of brain evoked responses, like event-related potentials (ERPs), requires multiple processing stages, in the spatial and temporal domains, to extract high level features. Convolutional neural networks, as a type of deep learning method, have been used for EEG signal detection as the underlying structure of the EEG signal can be included in such system, facilitating the learning step. The EEG signal is typically decomposed into 2 main dimensions: space and time. However, the spatial dimension can be decomposed into 2 dimensions that better represent the relationships between the sensors that are involved in the classification. We propose to analyze the performance of 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks for the classification of ERPs with a dataset based on 64 EEG channels. We propose and compare 6 conv net architectures: 4 using 3D convolutions, that vary in relation to the number of layers and feature maps, and 2 using 2D convolutions. The results support the conclusion that 3D convolutions provide better performance than 2D convolutions for the binary classification of ERPs.",0
"The increasing demand for food production due to the growing population is raising the need for more food-productive environments for plants. The genetic behavior of plant traits remains different in different growing environments. However, it is tedious and impossible to look after the individual plant component traits manually. Plant breeders need computer vision-based plant monitoring systems to analyze different plants' productivity and environmental suitability. It leads to performing feasible quantitative analysis, geometric analysis, and yield rate analysis of the plants. Many of the data collection methods have been used by plant breeders according to their needs. In the presented review, most of them are discussed with their corresponding challenges and limitations. Furthermore, the traditional approaches of segmentation and classification of plant phenotyping are also discussed. The data limitation problems and their currently adapted solutions in the computer vision aspect are highlighted, which somehow solve the problem but are not genuine. The available datasets and current issues are enlightened. The presented study covers the plants phenotyping problems, suggested solutions, and current challenges from data collection to classification steps.",0
"Purpose:
        
      
      To investigate a deep learning approach that enables three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of an arbitrary structure of interest given a user provided two-dimensional (2D) contour for context. Such an approach could decrease delineation times and improve contouring consistency, particularly for anatomical structures for which no automatic segmentation tools exist.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A series of deep learning segmentation models using a Recurrent Residual U-Net with attention gates was trained with a successively expanding training set. Contextual information was provided to the models, using a previously contoured slice as an input, in addition to the slice to be contoured. In total, 6 models were developed, and 19 different anatomical structures were used for training and testing. Each of the models was evaluated for all 19 structures, even if they were excluded from the training set, in order to assess the model's ability to segment unseen structures of interest. Each model's performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance, and relative added path length (APL).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The segmentation performance for seen and unseen structures improved when the training set was expanded by addition of structures previously excluded from the training set. A model trained exclusively on heart structures achieved a DSC of 0.33, HD of 44 mm, and relative APL of 0.85 when segmenting the spleen, whereas a model trained on a diverse set of structures, but still excluding the spleen, achieved a DSC of 0.80, HD of 13 mm, and relative APL of 0.35. Iterative prediction performed better compared to direct prediction when considering unseen structures.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Training a contextual deep learning model on a diverse set of structures increases the segmentation performance for the structures in the training set, but importantly enables the model to generalize and make predictions even for unseen structures that were not represented in the training set. This shows that user-provided context can be incorporated into deep learning contouring to facilitate semi-automatic segmentation of CT images for any given structure. Such an approach can enable faster de-novo contouring in clinical practice.",0
"Image data has grown exponentially as systems have increased their ability to collect and store it. Unfortunately, there are limits to human resources both in time and knowledge to fully interpret and manage that data. Computer Vision (CV) has grown in popularity as a discipline for better understanding visual data. Computer Vision has become a powerful tool for imaging analytics in orthopedic surgery, allowing computers to evaluate large volumes of image data with greater nuance than previously possible. Nevertheless, even with the growing number of uses in medicine, literature on the fundamentals of CV and its implementation is mainly oriented toward computer scientists rather than clinicians, rendering CV unapproachable for most orthopedic surgeons as a tool for clinical practice and research. The purpose of this article is to summarize and review the fundamental concepts of CV application for the orthopedic surgeon and musculoskeletal researcher.",0
"Background:
        
      
      The distribution, utilisation and accessibility of surgical robotics in England is unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A nationwide Freedom of Information (FOI) request was sent to all acute National Health Service (NHS) trusts. Accessibility was assessed for 32 843 Lower Super Output Areas in England.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All 149 acute NHS trusts responded to the FOI request. Sixty-one robots are distributed between 48 trusts. The number of robots and robotic procedures has increased annually. Urological procedures comprise 84.2% of robotic procedures. Procedure volume varies between robotic centres ranging from 1 to 683 in 2018. Over 2.4 million people have a travel time of over 1 hour to their nearest robotic centre.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      National accessibility to robotic services and case volumes are variable and does not represent good value for the NHS. A national robotic surgery registry could improve the quality of robotic surgery and is needed to dynamically assess national provision of this technology.",0
"Background:
        
      
      In recent years, surgical robots have become an indispensable part of the medical field. Surgical robots are increasingly being used in the areas of gynaecological surgery, urological surgery, orthopaedic surgery, general surgery and so forth. In this paper, the development of surgical robots in different operations is reviewed and analysed. In the type of master-slave surgical robotic system, the robotic surgical instrument arms were located in the execution terminal of a surgical robot system, as one of the core components, and directly contact with the patient during the operation, which plays an important role in the efficiency and safety of the operation. In clinical, the arm function and design in different systems varies. Furtherly, the current research progress of robotic surgical instrument arms used in different operations is analysed and summarised. Finally, the challenge and trend are concluded.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      According to the classification of surgical types, the development of surgical robots for laparoscopic surgery, neurosurgery, orthopaedics and microsurgery are analysed and summarised. Then, focusing on the research of robotic surgical instrument arms, according to structure type, the research and application of straight-rod surgical instrument arm, joint surgical instrument arm and continuous surgical instrument arm are analysed respectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      According to the discussion and summary of the characteristics of the existing surgical robots and instrument arms, it is concluded that they still have a lot of room for development in the future. Therefore, the development trends of the surgical robot and instrument arm are discussed and analysed in the five aspects of structural materials, modularisation, telemedicine, intelligence and human-machine collaboration.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Surgical robots have shown the development trend of miniaturisation, intelligence, autonomy and dexterity. Thereby, in the field of science and technology, the research on the next generation of minimally invasive surgical robots will usher in a peak period of development.",0
"In reinforcement learning, reward-driven feature learning directly from high-dimensional images faces two challenges: sample-efficiency for solving control tasks and generalization to unseen observations. In prior works, these issues have been addressed through learning representation from pixel inputs. However, their representation faced the limitations of being vulnerable to the high diversity inherent in environments or not taking the characteristics for solving control tasks. To attenuate these phenomena, we propose the novel contrastive representation method, Action-Driven Auxiliary Task (ADAT), which forces a representation to concentrate on essential features for deciding actions and ignore control-irrelevant details. In the augmented state-action dictionary of ADAT, the agent learns representation to maximize agreement between observations sharing the same actions. The proposed method significantly outperforms model-free and model-based algorithms in the Atari and OpenAI ProcGen, widely used benchmarks for sample-efficiency and generalization.",0
"Microcatheters have enabled diverse minimally invasive endovascular operations and notable health benefits compared with open surgeries. However, with tortuous routes far from the arterial puncture site, the distal vascular regions remain challenging for safe catheter access. Therefore, we propose a wireless stent-shaped magnetic soft robot to be deployed, actively navigated, used for medical functions, and retrieved in the example M4 segment of the middle cerebral artery. We investigate shape-adaptively controlled locomotion in phantoms emulating the physiological conditions here, where the lumen diameter shrinks from 1.5 mm to 1 mm, the radius of curvature of the tortuous lumen gets as small as 3 mm, the lumen bifurcation angle goes up to 120°, and the pulsatile flow speed reaches up to 26 cm/s. The robot can also withstand the flow when the magnetic actuation is turned off. These locomotion capabilities are confirmed in porcine arteries ex vivo. Furthermore, variants of the robot could release the tissue plasminogen activator on-demand locally for thrombolysis and function as flow diverters, initiating promising therapies towards acute ischemic stroke, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, dural arteriovenous fistulas, and brain tumors. These functions should facilitate the robot's usage in new distal endovascular operations.",0
"Given the breakthroughs in key technologies, such as image recognition, deep learning and neural networks, artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be increasingly developed, leading to closer and deeper integration with an increasingly data-, knowledge- and brain labor-intensive medical industry. As society continues to advance and individuals become more aware of their health needs, the problems associated with the aging of the population are receiving increasing attention, and there is an urgent demand for improving medical technology, prolonging human life and enhancing health. Digestive system diseases are the most common clinical diseases and are characterized by complex clinical manifestations and a general lack of obvious symptoms in the early stage. Such diseases are very difficult to diagnose and treat. In recent years, the incidence of diseases of the digestive system has increased. As AI applications in the field of health care continue to be developed, AI has begun playing an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the digestive system. In this paper, the application of AI in assisted diagnosis and the application and prospects of AI in malignant and benign digestive system diseases are reviewed.",0
"At present, much of the research conducted worldwide focuses on extending the ability of surgical robots. One approach is to extend robotic dexterity. For instance, accessibility and dexterity of the surgical instruments remains the largest issue for reduced port surgery such as single port surgery or natural orifice surgery. To solve this problem, a great deal of research is currently conducted in the field of robotics. Enhancing the surgeon's perception is an approach that uses advanced sensor technology. The real-time data acquired through the robotic system combined with the data stored in the robot (such as the robot's location) provide a major advantage. This paper aims at introducing state-of-the-art products and pre-market products in this technological advancement, namely the robotic challenge in extending dexterity and hopefully providing the path to robotic surgery in the near future.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we perform advanced imaging. From high-resolution image reconstruction to predicting functional response from clinically acquired data, AI is promising to revolutionize clinical evaluation of lung performance, pushing the boundary in pulmonary functional imaging for patients suffering from respiratory conditions. In this review, we overview the current developments and expound on some of the encouraging new frontiers. We focus on the recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that enable reconstructing images, quantitating, and predicting functional responses of the lung. Finally, we shed light on the potential opportunities and challenges ahead in adopting AI for functional lung imaging in clinical settings.",0
"The paper suggests that AI ethics should pay attention to morally relevant systemic effects of AI use. It draws the attention of ethicists and practitioners to systemic risks that have been neglected so far in professional AI-related codes of conduct, industrial standards and ethical discussions more generally. The paper uses the financial industry as an example to ask: how can AI-enhanced systemic risks be ethically accounted for? Which specific issues does AI use raise for ethics that takes systemic effects into account? The paper (1) relates the literature about AI ethics to the ethics of systemic risks to clarify the moral relevance of AI use with respect to the imposition of systemic risks, (2) proposes a theoretical framework based on the ethics of complexity and (3) applies this framework to discuss implications for AI ethics concerned with AI-enhanced systemic risks.",0
"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of flexible noise control (FNC) image processing in off-line computed radiography (CR) portal images. An observer study was designed to compare FNC with multiobjective frequency processing (MFP) in images acquired using a CR portal imaging device (CRPID). The image processing of MFP and FNC used the same data and required no additional irradiation of patients, and all images were printed on 10-bit grey-level dry laser film. Four radiation technologists and one oncologist served as observers and evaluated 40 sets of images for three different treatment sites: brain, lung and pelvis. Six to 10 anatomical landmarks were selected from each treatment site. Each observer was asked to rate each landmark in terms of its clinical visibility and rate the ease of making the pertinent verification in the MFP- and FNC-processed images. In the ratings of the visibility of landmarks and for the verification of treatment ports, FNC-processed images were more visible than MFP-processed images except for several landmarks in the anteroposterior (AP) pelvis such as the pubic symphysis. The visibility of landmarks in FNC-processed images was comparable with that in MFP-processed images. The verification of treatment ports using the CRPID with FNC was generally achievable. In conclusion, this study suggests that FNC is effective for image processing of CR portal images.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been put forth as a potential means of improving and expediting violence risk assessment in forensic psychiatry. Furthermore, it has been proffered as a means of mitigating bias by replacing subjective human judgements with unadulterated data-driven predictions. A recent ethics analysis of AI-informed violence risk assessment enumerated some potential benefits, ethics concerns, and recommendations for further discussion. The current review builds on this previous work by highlighting additional important practical and ethics considerations. These include extant technology for violence risk assessment, paradigmatic concerns with the application of AI to risk assessment and management, and empirical evidence of racial bias in the criminal justice system. Emphasis is given to problems of informed consent, maleficence (e.g., the known iatrogenic effects of overly punitive sanctions), and justice (particularly racial justice). AI appears well suited to certain medical applications, such as the interpretation of diagnostic images, and may well surpass human judgement in accuracy or efficiency with respect to some important tasks. Caution is necessary, however, when applying AI to processes like violence risk assessment that do not conform clearly to simple classification paradigms.",0
"Background:
        
      
      Data measuring airborne pollutants, public health and environmental factors are increasingly being stored and merged. These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment; 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure; and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential new directions, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of data mining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology. The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data. This suggests that many more fruitful applications can be expected in the future.",0
"The amount and quality of data being used in our everyday lives continue to advance in an unprecedented pace. This digital revolution has permeated healthcare, specifically spine surgery, allowing for very advanced and complex computational analytics, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The integration of these methods into clinical practice has just begun, and the following review article will describe AI/ML, demonstrate how it has been applied in adult spinal deformity surgery, and show its potential to improve patient care touching on future directions.",0
"In both research and care, patients, caregivers, and researchers are facing a leap forward in the quantity of data that are available for analysis and interpretation, marking the daunting ""big data era."" In the biomedical field, this quantitative shift refers mostly to the -omics that permit measuring and analyzing biological features of the same type as a whole. Omics studies have greatly impacted transplantation research and highlighted their potential to better understand transplant outcomes. Some studies have emphasized the contribution of omics in developing personalized therapies to avoid graft loss. However, integrating omics data remains challenging in terms of analytical processes. These data come from multiple sources. Consequently, they may contain biases and systematic errors that can be mistaken for relevant biological information. Normalization methods and batch effects have been developed to tackle issues related to data quality and homogeneity. In addition, imputation methods handle data missingness. Importantly, the transplantation field represents a unique analytical context as the biological statistical unit is the donor-recipient pair, which brings additional complexity to the omics analyses. Strategies such as combined risk scores between 2 genomes taking into account genetic ancestry are emerging to better understand graft mechanisms and refine biological interpretations. The future omics will be based on integrative biology, considering the analysis of the system as a whole and no longer the study of a single characteristic. In this review, we summarize omics studies advances in transplantation and address the most challenging analytical issues regarding these approaches.",0
"This article considers recent ethical topics relating to medical AI. After a general discussion of recent medical AI innovations, and a more analytic look at related ethical issues such as data privacy, physician dependency on poorly understood AI helpware, bias in data used to create algorithms post-GDPR, and changes to the patient-physician relationship, the article examines the issue of so-called robot doctors. Whereas the so-called democratization of healthcare due to health wearables and increased access to medical information might suggest a positive shift in the patient-physician relationship, the physician's 'need to care' might be irreplaceable, and robot healthcare workers ('robot carers') might be seen as contributing to dehumanized healthcare practices.",0
"An important issue in medical robotics is communication between physicians and robots. Speech-based communication is of particular advantage in robot-assisted surgery. It frees the surgeon's hands; hence, he can focus on the principal tasks. Man-machine voice communication is the subject of research in various domains (industry, social robotics), but medical robots are very specific. They must precisely synchronize their activities with operators. Voice commands must be possibly short. They must be executed without significant delays. An important factor is the use of a vision system that provides visual information in direct synchronization with surgeon actions. Its functions could be also controlled using speech. The aim of the research presented in this paper was to develop a method facilitating creation of voice-controlled medical robotic systems, fulfilling the mentioned requirements and taking into account possible scenarios of man-machine collaboration in such systems. A robot skill description (RSD) format was proposed in order to facilitate programming of voice control applications. A sample application was developed, and experiments were conducted in order to draw conclusions regarding the usefulness of speech-based interfaces in medical robotics. The results show that a reasonable selection of system functions controlled by voice may lead to significant improvement of man-machine collaboration.",0
"Sequential pattern mining (SPM) is a major class of data mining topics with a wide range of applications. The continuity and uncertain nature of trajectory data make it distinctively different from typical transactional data, which requires additional data transformation to prepare for SPM. However, little research focuses on comparing the performance of SPM algorithms and their applications in the context of trajectory data. This study selected some representative sequential pattern mining algorithms and evaluated them with various parameters to understand the effect of the involved parameters on their performances. We studied the resultant sequential patterns, runtime, and RAM consumption in the context of the taxi trajectory dataset, the T-drive dataset. It was demonstrated in this work that a method to discretize trajectory data and different SPM algorithms were performed on trajectory databases. The results were visualized on actual Beijing road maps, reflecting traffic congestion conditions. Results demonstrated contiguous constraint-based algorithms could provide a concise representation of output sequences and functions at low min_sup with balanced RAM consumption and execution time. This study can be used as a guide for academics and professionals when determining the most suitable SPM algorithm for applications that involve trajectory data.",0
"Electron tomography (ET) has emerged as a powerful technique to address fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biology. It makes possible visualization of the molecular architecture of complex viruses, organelles and cells at a resolution of a few nanometres. In the last decade ET has allowed major breakthroughs that have provided exciting insights into a wide range of biological processes. In ET the biological sample is imaged with an electron microscope, and a series of images is taken from the sample at different views. Prior to imaging, the sample has to be specially prepared to withstand the conditions within the microscope. Subsequently, those images are processed and combined to yield the three-dimensional reconstruction or tomogram. Afterwards, a number of computational steps are necessary to facilitate the interpretation of the tomogram, such as noise reduction, segmentation and analysis of subvolumes. As the computational demands are huge in some of the stages, high performance computing (HPC) techniques are used to make the problem affordable in reasonable time. This article intends to comprehensively review the methods, technologies and tools involved in the different computational stages behind structural studies by ET, from image acquisition to interpretation of tomograms. The HPC techniques usually employed to cope with the computational demands are also briefly described.",0
"The widespread use of information technology in healthcare leads to extensive data collection, which can be utilised to enhance patient care and manage chronic illnesses. Our objective is to summarise previous studies that have used data mining or process mining methods in the context of chronic diseases in order to identify research trends and future opportunities. The review covers articles that pertain to the application of data mining or process mining methods on chronic diseases that were published between 2000 and 2022. Articles were sourced from PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google Scholar based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 71 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Based on the literature review results, we detected a growing trend in the application of data mining methods in diabetes research. Additionally, a distinct increase in the use of process mining methods to model clinical pathways in cancer research was observed. Frequently, this takes the form of a collaborative integration of process mining, data mining, and traditional statistical methods. In light of this collaborative approach, the meticulous selection of statistical methods based on their underlying assumptions is essential when integrating these traditional methods with process mining and data mining methods. Another notable challenge is the lack of standardised guidelines for reporting process mining studies in the medical field. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to enhance the clinical interpretation of data mining and process mining results.",0
"If you read the news either as hard copy or online I am sure that you notice reports about the presence and use of robots more frequently; and often these have a positive message related to the benefits and advantages of the use of robots. My most recent encounter with similar news was last week's reading about a robot in the US, called VGo, which helped to 'Diagnose concussion on the football field' of an American football player (Erikson 2016). Not to mention other titles such as ""Robots are coming to grandma's nursing home"" (Schiller 2016)!",0
"Electron crystallography of membrane proteins uses cryo-transmission electron microscopy to record images and diffraction patterns of frozen-hydrated 2D crystals. Each two-dimensional (2D) crystal is only imaged once, at one specific tilt angle, and the recorded images can be automatically processed with the 2dx/MRC software package. Processed image data from non-tilted and tilted 2D crystals then need to be merged into a 3D reconstruction of the membrane protein structure. We here describe the process of the 3D merging, using the 2dx software system.",0
"Background:
        
      
      The development of robotic technology has facilitated the application of minimally invasive techniques for complex operations in gynecologic oncology.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The objective of the study was to assess and summarize the current literature on the role of robot-assisted surgery in cervical cancer in terms of its utility and outcome.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Literature review concerning the use of robot-assisted technology in the management of cervical cancer, including radical hysterectomy, trachelectomy, parametrectomy, pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy, and pelvic exenteration, was performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      To date, 12 articles addressing radical hysterectomy, 5 articles of radical trachelectomy, and 6 articles of surgical procedure in advanced or recurrent cervical cancer, all performed robotically, are published in the literature. The advantages of the robotic system include 3-dimensional vision, tremor reduction, motion downscaling, improved ergonomics, and greater dexterity with instrument articulation. Because of these benefits, the robotic technology seems to facilitate the surgical approach for technically challenging operations performed to treat primary, early or advanced, and recurrent cervical cancer as evidenced by the current literature.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Surgical management of cervical cancer may be one of the gynecologic oncology surgeries that can take full advantage of robotic assistance in a minimally invasive manner. Continued research and clinical trials are needed to further elucidate the equivalence or superiority of robot-assisted surgery to conventional methods in terms of oncological outcome and patient's quality of life.",0
"Reinforcement of variability may help to explain operant learning. Three groups of rats were reinforced, in different phases, whenever the following target sequences of left (L) and right (R) lever presses occurred: LR, RLL, LLR, RRLR, RLLRL, and in Experiment 2, LLRRL. One group (variability [VAR]) was concurrently reinforced once per minute for sequence variations, a second group also once per minute but independently of variations, that is, for any sequences (ANY), and a control group (CON) received no additional reinforcers. The 3 groups learned the easiest targets equally. For the most difficult targets, CON animals' responding extinguished whereas both VAR and ANY responded at high rates. Only the VAR animals learned, however. Thus, concurrent reinforcers--contingent on variability or not--helped to maintain responding when difficult sequences were reinforced, but learning those sequences depended on reinforcement of variations.",0
"Radiology reporting is narrative, and its content depends on the clinician's ability to interpret the images accurately. A tertiary hospital, such as anonymous institute, focuses on writing reports narratively as part of training for medical personnel. Nevertheless, free-text reports make it inconvenient to extract information for clinical audits and data mining. Therefore, we aim to convert unstructured breast radiology reports into structured formats using natural language processing (NLP) algorithm. This study used 327 de-identified breast radiology reports from the anonymous institute. The radiologist identified the significant data elements to be extracted. Our NLP algorithm achieved 97% and 94.9% accuracy in training and testing data, respectively. Henceforth, the structured information was used to build the predictive model for predicting the value of the BIRADS category. The model based on random forest generated the highest accuracy of 92%. Our study not only fulfilled the demands of clinicians by enhancing communication between medical personnel, but it also demonstrated the usefulness of mineable structured data in yielding significant insights.",0
"With the implementation of national strategies such as sports power and national fitness, the sports economy has become an important element of high-quality national development, and the demand for sports economy and management talents is greatly increased. Particularly in the new area with big data as the typical feature, the teaching content, teaching method, and teaching mode of sports economics and management majors have put forward new requirements. The continuous progress of storage and network technology has prompted the generation of massive multisource spatiotemporal data in various fields. The advantage of association analysis algorithms is that they are easy to code and implement. The relationships found by association analysis can take two forms: frequent itemsets or association rules. We use correlation analysis methods to perform correlation learning between sports economy and related big data and thus improve the development of sports economy. Mining and analyzing the relevant big data can precisely reveal the problems of sports economic development and can realize the fine management of sports, thus contributing to the healthy development of sports. Mastering the skills of acquiring, analyzing, and applying big data is the core content of sports economic analysis. The sports economy has refined and intelligent management means, and its adoption of virtual reality reflects the current situation and development trend of the sports business, which further highlights the status and role of multisource big data in the sports economy. Based on these, this paper proposed a sports economy mining algorithm in view of the correlation analysis and big data model. Then, we verified the effectiveness of the model through experiments, which laid the foundation for the development of the sports economy.",0

"The myoelectric prosthesis is a promising tool to restore the hand abilities of amputees, but the classification accuracy of surface electromyography (sEMG) is not high enough for real-time application. Researchers proposed integrating sEMG signals with another feature that is not affected by amputation. The strong coordination between vision and hand manipulation makes us consider including visual information in prosthetic hand control. In this study, we identified a sweet period during the early reaching phase in which the vision data could yield a higher accuracy in classifying the grasp patterns. Moreover, the visual classification results from the sweet period could be naturally integrated with sEMG data collected during the grasp phase. After the integration, the accuracy of grasp classification increased from 85.5% (only sEMG) to 90.06% (integrated). Knowledge gained from this study encourages us to further explore the methods for incorporating computer vision into myoelectric data to enhance the movement control of prosthetic hands.",0
"In early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its subsequent lockdown affected nearly the entire world.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that simulate human cognition in order to address a specific problem. The improvement in computing speed, the exponential production and the routine collection of data have led to the rapid development of AI in the health sector. In this review, we propose to provide surgeons with the essential technical elements to help them understand the possibilities offered by AI and to review the current applications of AI for oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS). The review of the literature reveals a real research boom of AI in all fields in OMFS. The algorithms used are related to machine learning, with a strong representation of the convolutional neural networks specific to deep learning. The complex architecture of these networks gives them the capacity to extract and process the elementary characteristics of an image, and they are therefore particularly used for diagnostic purposes on medical imagery or facial photography. We identified representative articles dealing with AI algorithms providing assistance in diagnosis, therapeutic decision, preoperative planning, or prediction and evaluation of the outcomes. Thanks to their learning, classification, prediction and detection capabilities, AI algorithms complement human skills while limiting their imperfections. However, these algorithms should be subject to rigorous clinical evaluation, and ethical reflection on data protection should be systematically conducted.",0
"The prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a vital step in drug discovery. The success of machine learning and deep learning methods in accurately predicting DTIs plays a huge role in drug discovery. However, when dealing with learning algorithms, the datasets used are usually highly dimensional and extremely imbalanced. To solve this issue, the dataset must be resampled accordingly. In this paper, we have compared several data resampling techniques to overcome class imbalance in machine learning methods as well as to study the effectiveness of deep learning methods in overcoming class imbalance in DTI prediction in terms of binary classification using ten (10) cancer-related activity classes from BindingDB. It is found that the use of Random Undersampling (RUS) in predicting DTIs severely affects the performance of a model, especially when the dataset is highly imbalanced, thus, rendering RUS unreliable. It is also found that SVM-SMOTE can be used as a go-to resampling method when paired with the Random Forest and Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifiers, whereby a high F1 score is recorded for all activity classes that are severely and moderately imbalanced. Additionally, the deep learning method called Multilayer Perceptron recorded high F1 scores for all activity classes even when no resampling method was applied.",0
"Active vibrissal touch can be used to replace or to supplement sensory systems such as computer vision and, therefore, improve the sensory capacity of mobile robots. This paper describes how arrays of whisker-like touch sensors have been incorporated onto mobile robot platforms taking inspiration from biology for their morphology and control. There were two motivations for this work: first, to build a physical platform on which to model, and therefore test, recent neuroethological hypotheses about vibrissal touch; second, to exploit the control strategies and morphology observed in the biological analogue to maximize the quality and quantity of tactile sensory information derived from the artificial whisker array. We describe the design of a new whiskered robot, Shrewbot, endowed with a biomimetic array of individually controlled whiskers and a neuroethologically inspired whisking pattern generation mechanism. We then present results showing how the morphology of the whisker array shapes the sensory surface surrounding the robot's head, and demonstrate the impact of active touch control on the sensory information that can be acquired by the robot. We show that adopting bio-inspired, low latency motor control of the rhythmic motion of the whiskers in response to contact-induced stimuli usefully constrains the sensory range, while also maximizing the number of whisker contacts. The robot experiments also demonstrate that the sensory consequences of active touch control can be usefully investigated in biomimetic robots.",0
